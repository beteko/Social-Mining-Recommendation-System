generalisation multi objective dominance relations encompasses condensed representations closed maximal pattern mining finding relevant subgroups Negrevergne Interestingly these approaches unmodified solvers still obtain reasonable efficiency especially constraints present 2011a level constraint these formulations reified weighted constraint Boolean variables where reified means truth value constraint reflected Boolean indicator variable Notable respect implement solver Boolean variables using structures itemset mining algorithms achieve scalability depth first itemset mining while having generality other solvers itemset mining Nijssen Constraint programming sequence mining sequential pattern ordered events sequential ordering differs traditional unordered interpretation itemset pattern Furthermore event reoccur multiple times sequential pattern property pattern mining method ability compute frequency pattern consists verifying entry database whether pattern occurs entry entry often called transaction itemsets corresponds verifying pattern subset transaction sequences subsequence transaction Works constraint programming constraint based mining divided camps based representation sequence Sequences explicit wildcards example where wildcard match transaction contains followed single arbitrary event followed immediately event would match transaction would match problem formulated similar frequent itemset mining Coquery hence constraints variations expressed including frequent closed maximal Coquery relevant subgroups Kemmar Sequences implicit wildcards traditional sequence pattern consi dered where pattern subsequence there implicit wildcards between symbols difficult express constraint solver Métivier general testing subsequence relation individual transaction requires searching possible matchings which worst exponential overcome first global constraint transparently solver second decompose subsequence constraint treat transaction independent subproblem requires search Negrevergne former approach efficient prefix projection technique PrefixSpan including pruning infrequent extensions better scalability obtained having global constraint transactions instead having separate constraint transac Kemmar sequences shows itemsets quite exceptional constraints including condensed representations expressed using standard constraints available multi objective optimisation dominance relations require changes solving procedure other model sequence while obtaining reasonable solving performance specialised constraints search procedures written Furthermore subsequence check within global constraint efficient allow change subsequence relation enforce maximum between matching elements without changing implementing constraint There hence still
