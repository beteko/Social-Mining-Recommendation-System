semantics trait encompasses bound confidence width ability detect would blocked confidence boost bound embodies bounds proposed notions confidence width blocking similar pruning proposal intuition proposal follows logous intuitive Major differences proposals discuss large portion pruning becomes unnecessary because minimum bases representative rules proposed importantly pruning Objective Novelty Confidence Boost based statistic whereas instead confidence thresholds would redundant notions similar notion improvement proposed briefly discussed several differences denote itemsets capital letters alphabet juxtaposi denote union given dataset consisting transactions which itemset labeled unique transaction identifier count support itemset which cardinality transactions contain confidence association rules along paper assume allow Objective Novelty Measures propose measure novelty respect outcome mining process Among number notions redundancy among association rules there precise natural notion allows characterizing irredundant bases minimum Lemma association rules following equivalent every dataset these cases makes redundant logically stronger fixed confidence threshold those rules reach redundant other rules above threshold representative essential basis confidence threshold Confidence Width intuition redundancy pushed further order perspective novelty association rules irredundant basis because confidence higher basis would suggest higher evaluated means following definition whole discussion assume dataset support threshold fixed rules assumed reach support Definition confidence width denominator confidence width infinite convention explain notion consider given confidence happens representative basis varying confi dence threshold being confidence threshold becomes output standard Balcázar association mining process could other logically stronger appears confidence instance could rules confidence redundant belong basis confidence stronger appears belong representative basis shold decreasing threshold lower confidence logically stronger appear logically stronger shows early confidence threshold close novel similar logically stronger shows interval confidence thresholds where representative short contrary stronger appear rules lower confidence entail reach confidence novel sense interval confidence thresholds where representative large Blocking Rules disadvantage often argued against confidence relates unability detect correlations instance threshold around consider repre sentative confidence slightly beyond threshold going provided interesting output suggesting transactions having However actual frequency rather correlation negative since appears often among transactions having whole dataset major criticism confidence measure degree impli cation motivated large number alternatives literature about these notions quite large survey references Reference suggests notion blocking specific motivating example described paper follows mining association rules support confidence Adult training Irvine rules basis Husband something reason Husband would expect reach confidence indeed tuple includes items Husband Female instead opens rules intuitively uninformative enlarge enough avoid tuple reach confidence Further examples given paper approach problem proposes scheme explained equivalent follows Definition Given proper subset blocks blocking threshold definition compares number tuples having quantity would predicted confidence distributed along support ratio along larger support would expect difference numerator negative would lower would suggest positive quotient still bring enough confidence respect considered remains blocked quotient larger happens becomes novel since confidence higher enough suggested rules checked problems Adult dataset alluded above solved later confidence width bound blocking bound related follows confidence width bound blocking bound Objective Novelty Confidence Boost Confidence Boost definition notion similar given confidence width twist though formally semantically changes enough encompass notion blocking Definition confidence boost Again denominator confidence boost infinite convention Under assumption actually equivalent confidence boost corresponds novelty suppose where slightly larger According definition there different inequality stating transactions confidence relatively lower equivalently confidence higher could lower transactions having transactions having confidence found novel given additional confidence states namely minimum should consider rules confidence boost Notice solves objection against confidence negative correlations undetected instance support confidence would indeed yield confidence boost below rules filtered output association miner width filtered boost threshold because clearly shown blocking provided account difference meaning thresholds blocked itemset blocking threshold rather directly there Hence bounding confidence boost ensures rules would filtered either checks blocking threshold filtered confidence boost bound sense confidence boost embodies novelty tests thresholds employed there Computing Confidence Boost Applications order practical deeper study confidence boost currently stands makes sense traverse alternative rules taken account computing maximum confidence denominator difficulty appears confidence width blocking precomputation allows compute quite efficiently width method blocking boost experiments reported indicated there resort approximation blocking actual
