those itemsets appear often enough subsets transactions their relative frequency exceeds certain ratio transactions Agrawal second problem often rules provided output specially consider purpose human studies notions redundancy exist limit output irredundant rules according several existing notions redundancy Kryszkiewicz taking redundancies account results cases unsatisfactory implication

Experimentation vironment processes transactional datasets transaction being itemset obtains irredundant rules where arbitrary disjoint itemsets require select value threshold parameter current propos frequent closed itemsets apply known redundancy filters current closure mining algorithm simplified variant ChARM Hsiao rather close depth first search associators closures order decreasing support
