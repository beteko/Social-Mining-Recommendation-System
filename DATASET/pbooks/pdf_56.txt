Recommendation based Keyword Search Relational Databases Haithem Ghorbel Nouha Othman Université Tunis Institut Supérieur Gestion Tunis LARODEC Tunisia haithem othmannouha gmail Université Carthage Carthage LARODEC Tunisia Abstract Recently there burgeoning interest keyword search tional databases owing Although extensive research lately within context research requires prior access which severely restricts their applicability condition verified returns generic answers However providing users personalized answers become necessary overabundance which annoying challenge return personalized relevant answers satisfy users information needs remains Inspired successful application collaborative filtering technique recommender systems propose novel keyword based approach provide users personalized results based pothesis information database schema available Introduction decades explosive amount structured stored Relational Databases These latter widely owing information provide including relationships between different entities Developing effective query methods users easily query complex repositories without technical expertise become biggest challenges database community Agrawal Aditya emergence search engines keyword search commonly search technique strength latter enables users easily express their information needs keywords without needing database schema structured query languages Nevertheless technique requires prior access database content order build indices pinpoint different tuples associated keywords Bergamaschi considerable shortcoming since limits applicability prior access possible Another significant limitation inter dependencies among query keywords ignored Actually meaning keyword query depends meaning others other tremendous development information technol amount growing exponentially finding desired information massive database become crucial challenging Recommendation Systems powerful tools filter providing likely looking paper propose successful attempt combine techniques overcome limitation keyword search proposed approach returning personalized answers prior access actual stored database remainder paper structured follows Section review existing querying describe Recommendation based Keyword Search Relational approach Section Subsequently present Section report experimental evaluation results Towards conclude outline perspectives Related Querying Relational Databases Arguably keyword search become standard seeking information allows easily formulate queries keywords However simplicity comes price keywords fraught ambiguity their intended meaning needs explored further years advanced approaches keyword search ments proposed return relevant answers These approaches though return results systems style search considers tuples unstructured while retrieved information spread among tables Unlike textual documents tuples linked through foreign primary constraints foreign primary paths connecting tuples contain keywords represent essential ingredient solving keyword query database Defining representation models databases retrieve these paths these reasons direct application keyword based approaches relational databases where information fragmented numerous tables neither efficient effective Bergamaschi Indeed multiple systems proposed literature where popular BANKS Aditya BANKSII

KEYMANTIC KEYRY systems Tuple based approaches BANKS BANKS model database graph wherein nodes represent tuples edges denote relationships between tuples foreign primary pendencies particularity graph nodes edges typically weighted which provides users information objects interconnected KEYMANTIC KEYRY tackled issue keyword search differently provide answers query without necessity prior access stored database build indices locate tuples Proposed Solution approach called DeepRec combine keyword search techniques recommender systems DeepRec integrating recommendation databases concepts better personalized answers simple keyword based query posted provides recommendations serendipitous answers prior access database allowed relying schema users information different components given approach detailed below Ghorbel Schema Terms Matching first phase named Schema Weight Computation consists determining which keywords match schema terms attributes relations starting query schema information database Attributes relations considered metadata order estimate keyword attribute relation distance opted Levenshtein measure which computes minimal insertions deletions replacements needed transforming string string However simple string similarity between keyword schema enough heterogeneity vocabulary different words figure schema information database purpose employ WordNet Sense Disambiguation keyword compared synonyms hyponyms hypernyms every schema having highest similarity second phase named Schema Weight Personalization consists updating Schema Weight Matrix making information gathered users profiles concept Collaborative Filtering build profiles users their search history similar users history personalize results compute Personalized Schema Weight sessions information update matrix Similar sessions indexed table calculate times every schema maximum value queries similar sessions store result computation specific column matrix value column combined analogue column values their corresponding cells other words weight values column variable affects first values depending number times column maximum value Computing possible matching keywords database terms known assignment problem popular Munkres Hungarian algorithm Munkres possible solution problem provides matching Bergamaschi Domnori Guerra Trillo Velegrakis adapted algorithm context after generation mapping continue generate other Besides weight matrix dynamically updated every mapping keyword database decided during calculation Value Weight Contextualization Value Weight matrix computation performed Bergamaschi Domnori Guerra Trillo Velegrakis computation mainly within domain information attributes KEYMANTIC semantic distance estimate relatedness concepts every matrix contains value indicator eligibility suitability keyword attribute domain keywords already mapped schema previous assigned every their lines ensure recomputed After computation mapping schema terms value weight matrix matrix updated according terms mapped schema keywords queries keyword refer either schema value schema contextualize value weight matrix according terms mapped schema terms taking consideration keywords positions query describe concept basic intuition behind method check keyword corresponds schema mapped corresponds keyword mapped schema situations arise relation weight attributes every adjacent keywords otherwise attribute relation increase weights attribute related attributes functional dependencies keywords neighboring Recommendation based Keyword Search Relational functions retrieve following preceding keywords neighboring respectively variable value proportional distance between keywords output contextualized Value Weight Matrix Again extension Hungarian Algorithm assignments Generation personalized query answers related matching keywords terms producing together combination named score combination weights associated queries achieved possession first score combinations latter reside keywords match their adequate database terms without defining relations between terms Works process under assumption prior access Bergamaschi consider similarity between keywords attributes domain attributes similarities which always appropriate limitation advan profiles built approach personalize answers Giving current making query current session compute similarity query previous queries sessions using cosine similarity answer gained interest credited associated query fairly similar current query Experimental Evaluation Experimental Setup
