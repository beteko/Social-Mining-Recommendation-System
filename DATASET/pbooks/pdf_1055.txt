Database computer science Today October indexes publications published authors accessed million times month maintained department build bibliographic database always requires decisions between quality quantity describe publication metadata include classifications citation links abstracts restrict minimum authors title publication venue journal address decided minimalistic approach limited resources prevent produce detailed metadata substantial number attribute metadata degree consistency makes difference produce number bibliographic records without standardization journal names conference names person names guarantee entity journal conference person always represented exactly character string tities share representation maintenance becomes expensive Traditionally process called authority control number different journals dreds number different conference series thousands guarantee consistency scale requires problem moderate sized biblio graphic database authority control person names harder magnitude available information often incomplete contradictory Process Driven Quality Management Quality comprises different dimensions aspects Redman presents dimension completeness accuracy correctness currency consistency Redman Other aspects unambiguity credibility timeliness meaningfulness overview different dimensions quality obtained Johnson Scannapieco Information acquisition critical phase quality management there broad range primary information sources Usually electronic documents sometimes information typed important sources SpringerLink Lecture Notes Computer Science series provide basic information highly structured format which transform internal formats diversely formatted sources economic develop wrapper programs standard editor adhoc scripts transform input format suitable software cases front pages title pages table contents journal proceedings volume table contents often contains information inferior article itself Sometimes given names authors abbreviated affiliation information authors often missing tables contents contain errors especially produced under pressure proceedings article itself typographic errors simple important policy enter

danger become biased favor person Timeliness achieve journal issues proceedings completely entered published Reuther early design decision generate author pages person authored edited publication

Elmacioglu interpret publication edges coauthor graph incrementation weights existing edges publication authors existing collection several simple search tools variety matching algorithms cases traditional regular expressions useful tricky distance functions lookup essentially manual process driven intuition experience efficiently person names which might misspelled incomplete Usually manual lookup process organized levels students formatting necessary first lookup annotate articles names which require further investigation background knowledge Often students incomplete errorless entries database second table contents problematic cases treated errors database corrected Finally information entered database During stage simple formatting conventions checked scripts example warned there consecutive upper characters person typical working bibliographic records unrealistic belief possible without introducing errors without overlooking unavoidable during input process varies obvious

Bibliographical Database Driven Quality Management driven strategies divided database bashing edits behind database bashing compare crosscheck stored database different sources other database information world persons order errors confirm quality original Database bashing useful error detection however correction errors troublesome there differences between records assumed records describing entity different sources question arises which records correct whether those occurrences hundred percent correct edits focus comparison records different sources business rules These business rules specific domain database domain bibliographic records example Alert there authors dataset slightly their spelling exactly authors Exactly implemented simple software build structure which represents coauthor graph algorithm checks pairs author nodes which distance graph names these nodes similar should suspect represent person StringDistance warning StringDistance function threshold value required experimentation moment modified version classical Levenshtein distance implements special rules diacritical characters umlauts accents abbreviated parts program produces several thousand warnings problem false drops suspicious pairs which resolved because information cases missing puzzle example personal pages scientists themselves often information available reasonable effort found economical persons whose publication lists modified recently these persons likely resolve contradictory spellings complete abbreviated parts simple software sketched above daily since years helped locate large number errors should replaced improved system reasons still errors accidentally understood search process precision warnings still spend suspicious pairs names resolve Because invest error corrections limited which points promising cases Framework Person Matching Outlook experimenting flexible software framework person matching ideas makes sense apply distance functions pairs person names lection because product space large algorithms 400000 because comparing totally unrelated names produces false drops distance Reuther coauthor graph heuristic
