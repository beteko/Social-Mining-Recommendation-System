perception about estate properties individuals agents formed exclusively their intrinsic characteristics property externalities pollution traffic congestion criminality rates proximity playgrounds schools stimulat social interactions equally important paper present Estate System contrary existing Estate services applications takes account important externalities leveraging content Social Networks listings applications enables thorough analysis current physical social context property context based objective valuation properties along advanced property search selection experience unveils otherwise property features significantly reduces effort spent their quest system encompasses above provide services which assist individuals agents making informed sound decisions Introduction Contemporary estate economists Geltner agree value apartment building urban represented exclusively intrinsic characteristics property quality location construction positive externalities proximity playgrounds schools dynamic local cultural relations intellectual circuits exchange peaceful stimulating social interactions negative externalities noise pollution traffic congestion noisy neighbours criminality rates Estate contrary existing Estate services applications foxtons restricted intrinsic characteristics properties harvest integrate various forms Estate information actually available today various sources under point interest content opinions expressed foxtons Leveraging Informed Estate Services Social other relevant information published system threefold first provide highly personalized access through integrated information space means spatial temporal content related constraints second support multi criteria analysis evaluation location aspects affect final strategic investment decisions third provide Estate analytics reporting taking advantage character available first objective towards direction related acquisition distinct kinds property features surrounding properties social content under discussion posts online Social Media provide material evidence regarding physical social context properties mostly government sources provide official

portals Regarding acquisition Estate harvests relevant multitude administrative touristic sites including freely available databases social content related challenge respect ability steer acquisition process close certain geographical interest detection evolves Social content acquired several sources blogs forums social platforms Google Places Foursquare While blogs forums normally accessed pages access Google Places Foursquare different these sources limited access their through their about knowledge reused redistributed years enormous effort publishing scientific government sources Initiatives provide plethora datasets usually different formats acquisition integration system another challenging integration acquired information actually second objective determine quality actually exploited Estate services First property information needs integrated subtle issue respect related precision geographical information available associated neighbourhood broader areas instead specific
