alternative algorithm guaranteed output representative rules compute closed parameters depend confidence support thresholds above mentioned characterization generate representative rules Compared previous potentially incomplete algorithm Kryszkiewicz algorithm guaranteed complete drawback Kryszkiewicz internal local parameters depend support threshold algorithm these parameters depend

closed itemset second partition determine given value confidence threshold which those generate representative rules There couple subtle differences between usual definitions association employ Kryszkiewicz First allow having rules empty antecedent clearly confidence equal normalized support consequent Moreover require inequalities strict imposing given support confidence threshold small
