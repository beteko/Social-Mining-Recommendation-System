Specifically consider following rules Alternatively split consequents obeys these rules subtrees trees subtrees trees provide characterization implications operate similar Balcázar Garriga 2007a Balcázar Garriga 2007b translating rules specific propositional theory which characterize which basis rules sufficient infer rules dataset technical details depart somewhat Balcázar Garriga 2007b Mining Implications Lattices Closed Trees certain maximality condition imposed there different those Balcázar Garriga 2007a start associating propositional variable implication between trees propositional conjunction implications follows conjunction variables corresponding implies variables corresponding closure right propositional implication propositional translation trees corresponds natural propositional model specifically subtree abbreviate models obtained following condition condition identifies models model fulfills trees which Alternatively taken maximal trees which express condition clauses following holds Lemma satisfies propositional translations implications Since definition hence definition ensures claim collect closure based implications following algorithms below specify concrete rules among those closure operator closed trees consider immediate predecessors subsets closed where other intervening closed exists between define define family trees fulfill properties intersects minimal respect under condition following rules subset larger rules defined above state result Theorem Given dataset trees following propositional formulas logically equivalent conjunction formulas satisfied models conjunction propositional translations formulas Balcázar conjunction propositional translations formulas Proof first easily imply because Lemma means conjuncts belong Similarly trivially implies because conjuncts belong remains argue formula implies formula satisfied models whenever means equivalently prove there minimally intersects closed immediate predecessors since Together their joint propositional translations entail arbitrary model making fulfilling because holds Since available holds Therefore prove exists already intersects suppose proper predecessor intersect means smallest closed above below closed coincide neither possible Hence suffices consider trees where still intersect empty family since itself finite family therefore least minimal element respect picked completes proof Finding Implicit Rules Subtrees formally define inplicit rules follows Definition Given three trees implicit abbreviately implicit every holds trees

parable components Lemma trees implicit rules unique minimal common supertree Using Lemma compute implicit rules algorithmically expensive obtaining minimal common supertrees which quadratic avoid propose several heuristics speed process simple consequence these lemmas Corollary trees implicit rules particularly useful where formally prove implicit rules which helps detecting large amount dataset mining occurs trees single component Theorem Suppose incomparable trees component implicit rules maximum component which subtree component Proof Suppose incomparable trees described statement components component represent their structures graph ically Suppose maximum component which subtree Without generality assume component claim implicit where components Balcázar actually implicit suppose insight structure contain components where components there least components components suppose every Since subtree subtree every possible value subtree implicit cases other direction suppose maximum component which subtree there different minimal common supertrees Lemma desired conclusion previous condition maximal components split possibilities maximum component Lemma there maximal components which incomparable claim trees following figure different minimal common supertrees first place different Suppose equal since cannot subtree because assumed incomparable components containing match following multisets components equal equality holds which false Second contains minimally components order displayed except which Mining Implications Lattices Closed Trees Suppose delete getting whose components which corresponding except containing deleted contain analyzing possibilities location deleted either component other component Suppose deleted either since included other component suppose consider number occurrences Since maximal component occurrences components contain subtree Therefore number components contain exactly deleted Suppose deleted clear means mapping matches component different contradiction suppose there exists mapping permutation symmetric group elements every length cycle containing cycle representation value different exponents since every previous chain except while because maximum component previous chain containments conclude Putting together which contradiction Therefore conclude minimal common supertree Obviously property argued symmetric since different Lemma implies cannot implicit rules maximum components subtrees consider following trees bana1 minimal common supertree common supertree contain conclude different minimal common subtrees other obtained deleting leaves until minimal deleting leave would contain Since point holds other since minimal would Balcázar which contradicts point Therefore incomparable minimal common supertrees theorem follows complete proof minimal common supertree proof previous showing minimal common supertree applies argument based maximality maximum maximal proof applies common supertree contain Clearly definition common supertree argue inclusion should subtree component cannot subtree components since which false other cannot subtree neither because would which false Therefore contain Since proved existence minimal common supertrees application Lemma completes proof Corollary trees component implicit rules comparable fragment argumentation theorem applied directly
