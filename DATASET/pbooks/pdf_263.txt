Linked Annotation Fusion driven Quality Evaluation Ioanna Giannopoulou Fatiha Rallou Thomopoulos Paris University Lovelace 91405 Orsay Cedex France Supagro LIRMM Montpellier University Inria place Viala 34060 Montpellier cedex France Résumé interested exploring problem starting reconciled datasets whose objects linked semantic sameAs relations attempt merge often conflicting information these reconciled objects order obtain unified representations contain quality information Introduction linking known reconciliation Ferrara Pernelle process where object descriptions examined order determine whether refer world entity together fusion encompasses effort acquire single homogenized object merging information linked individual objects objects marked sameAs contain different conflicting inconsistent values their properties property appropriate value chosen fusion essential towards avoiding redundancy grouping together quality information giving consistent answers users linked environment Research fusion problem begun decades field relatio databases Bleiholder Naumann However examine fusion point notice specificities mechanisms cannot reflected solutions offered relational databases experts Three approaches proposed fusion Thomopoulos Flouris Mendes These different approaches attempt evaluate quality value taking account various measures based value itself metadata interested exploring problem fusion method bines different quality criteria based value source exploits whenever possible ontology semantics constraints relations create mecha provide explanations about quality value estimated system achieve generate annotations traceability explanation purposes approach described detail Section first evaluation presented Section Finally Section concludes paper gives future Linked Fusion Proposed solution Inspired approaches cited Section build system attempts offer solid automated solution fusion problem respect description conflict handling methods described Bleiholder Naumann approach automatic applies conflict resolution strategy instance based metadata based strategy shown sections solution adapted property exclude values implausible according specific rules exploit whenever sible ontology knowledge constraints relations natively treat multi valued properties importantly store information fusion decision order offer explanations
