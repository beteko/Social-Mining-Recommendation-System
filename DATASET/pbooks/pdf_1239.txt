effectuer tâche Quatre scénarios illustrent cette approche Introduction triteness computers widely various numerous tasks which mainly information management information organization storage communication retrieval sharing Furthermore information management environments increasingly customisable order closer users practices usages generally their needs handling information whatever example could consider environment composed resource provider documents viewing editing documents adapted involving information gathering publication spectrum computer mediated tasks becomes wider tools performing these tasks become versatile customisable Since other often inexperienced users there increasing assisting latter their tasks while using tools tools consequence there design software agents assistants which would advantage knowledge describing Indeed becomes necessary account tasks order interpret their context traces computer environment course situations assistance there variety questions formulated depending context stress notion context nothing commonly addressed called contextual latter exclusively considering computer environment context selected current while focusing context particular willing perform precisely consider kinds tasks First consider tasks identified which assistance would knowledge described carefully designed ontologies important consider second tasks which anticipate should recognized their manifestations defined considering actual experience system would address these tasks question possible model capture experience using system reused knowledge assistance Moreover could assistance itself could evolve concrete experience MUSETTE framework Knowledge Capture Experience group which comes Based Reasoning research field tracking reusing experience attempting propose solutions challenge across previous research works Mille Champin elaborate Musette Modelling Tasks Tracing Experience general framework representing concrete experience relation context section presents Musette global approach following sections present notions model traces explained signature split trace episodes potential reusable cases fifth section deals scenarios demonstrating different kinds Musette assistants action while sixth section devoted discussing related works principally field modelling Global approach Figure presents general framework approach leading clockwise observation level upper right corner experience reuse level lower levels experience modelling interacts system leading changes computing system events files observer agent observing these changes according observation model generates primitive trace which conforms general model generic trace analyser extracts significant episodes primitive trace according explained signatures These episodes assistant agents which assist either agents clearly distinct system direct assistance modification system system mediated assistance latter assistance interaction observed observer agent allowing assistance episodes reused emphasize Musette general framework implemented using various languages representation formalisms provided those enable representation every component Musette approach model traces Since Musette approach requires representation primitive trace interactions between system first applying approach decide trace actually constructed Those questions answered respectively model observation model order build observer agent charge producing trace Basically trace composed Objects Interest Those belong three following categories entities events relations Entities characterized objects Observer agent Primitive trace Episodes Episodes interaction direct assistance system mediated assistance Observation trace generation episode extraction Episode reuse System Observation Model signature signature Model Assistant agents Generic trace analyser Introducing approach vocabulary Champin being present their interaction system while events characterized objects happening during interaction Objects sense computer application Relations binary imply either entities events model particular system describes entities events relations actually observable produce primitive trace Additional constraints including internal structure model emphasize objects interest describe system interest implies depend particular focus however general model Deciding system interaction observed bounded biased model designer goals Describing components produced trace sufficient build observer though observation model still described means access relevant system rules constraining process producing trace which relevant subset observable entities written trace given moment Unlike model observation model specified Musette approach moment observer built every system particular model observation model coded manually observer observer agent specified model possibly coded observation model produce traces observation interactions between system structure trace limited continuous stream entities events possibly relation another Indeed entities represent state system given moment during period considered instant context model other events happen transitory period between states Hence grouping trace according their category turns trace alternate sequence states transitions worth noting states transitions Musette approach merely temporal intended convey predefined causal meaning course given model causal semantics specific kinds entities events relations defines Extasis episodes Assuming model enables appropriate description interactions system experience potentially retrievable primitive trace precisely episode trace corresponding specific experience performing specific which reused similar situation Pieces trace recognized episodes related particular thanks EXplained SIgnatures Extasis locate episodes primitive trace generally consider common features expressed pattern graph constituted objects interest events entities their relations constraints relative positions trace occurrences observations States Transitions distance between observations trace language dependent constraints internal structure attribute values these common features identified particular considered signature Indeed their instantiation trace interpreted evidence performing corresponding period Episodes limited parts trace instantiating signature though identified performed improve their interpretation trace roles MUSETTE framework Knowledge Capture Experience trace easier understand additional relations captured observer agent present model inferred Therefore episode annotated explained number information coming recognized occurrence particular Explanations annotation human could interpret formal knowledge annotation aimed automated agent interpretation Scenarios demonstrate different kinds assistants designed Musette approach considering browsing scenario specific assistant account given reusing episode instantiating corresponding Extasi example could build assistant would notify whenever browsing interesting whenever would episode matching Extasi Bookmarking interesting whose current specific assistant apply based reasoning mechanisms Aamodt Plaza reuse relevant episodes given context However advantage Musette approach knowledge primitive traces shared different assistants extracting different episodes Moreover assistant added without needing build completely knowledge Extasi provided order extract episodes existing traces second scenario involves generic assistant capable handling number tasks their Extasi regular exploring current trace respect particular instance could browse interesting sites already visited pages preferred French could suggested bookmark change language setting already similar Again assistant could perform those actions automatically advantage Musette every particular reified elicited corresponding Extasi explanations provided Extasi guide assistant understandable third scenario explicitly assistant latter identify being performed order select appropriate episodes reuse identification range explicit selection Extasi fully automatic detection current trace according available Extasis intermediate solution system propose various interpretations activity based partially instantiated Extasis corresponding explanations accept reject those interpretations until consensus reached fourth scenario further previous Assume proposed Extasis satisfy assistant could provide specify precisely willing perform example neither someone refine query adding keywords would rather submit query specialized search engine field specific language specific actually doing describing Extasi without specifying completely course since wants appropriate specialized search engine though Extasi known before might already performed therefore traces might contain episodes matching newly created Extasi indeed describe previously unknown still obtain assistance about separation Musette between Champin general model specific signatures leverages assistanceMerci respecter styles suivants listes Related works before digital computers
