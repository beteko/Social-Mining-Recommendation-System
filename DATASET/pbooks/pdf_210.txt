Python library topic modeling browsing objective allow efficient analy corpus start finish discovery latent topics features advanced functions preparing vectorizing offers unified interface topic models namely using either variational inference Gibbs sampling using alternating least square projected gradient method implements three state methods estimating optimal number topics model corpus constructs interactive based browser makes exploring topic model related corpus Introduction Topic models useful tools unveiling latent topical structure corpora searching browsing summarizing these corpora easier Several models algorithms approximate proposed recent years quality discovered topics depends model approximation algorithm nature corpus being studied number topics Stevens Therefore order perform efficient topic based analysis corpus important compare several approaches identify relevant topics However difficult because existing implementations approximation algorithms independent which means learn structured implementation functions manipulate topic model these topic models exact features other several methods proposed estimate optimal number topics model corpus knowledge their implementations publicly available short paper present TOpic Modeling source library written Python analyzing corpus start finish discovery latent topics Apart advanced corpus preparation functions offers unified interface existing robust implementations approximation algorithms makes fitting manipulating topic models implements several functions estimate optimal number
