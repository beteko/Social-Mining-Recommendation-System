contenu textuel généré utilisateurs Notre approche inscrit cette lignée informations extraites contenu textuel règles linguis tiques intégrées système apprentissage automatique montrerons prototype développé interface visualisation facilite interprétation résultats Introduction influencer person thing power affect people actions events fluencer detection concerns problem determining which users influence certain social network information crucial research studies ciology information management domains Additionally frenetic growth lable online social network being analyze detect influential users becomes crucial susceptible express their ideas strongly other individuals example information could marketing campaigns order maximize their spread Richardson Domingos Formally detecting influent users social network deals graph where represents users network interactions among Apart structural information assume produces information textual content content induce interactions between users through textual content Therefore consider detecting influencers following analyzing structure social networks their textual content method combines linguistic information along structural properties order machine learning model scoring users presented Eurostars project which concerns enhancement customer relationship management social media analysis capabilities somaproject Eurostars program 19892 Influence Detection Social Media Background Related Usually influence detection addressed analyzing structure mainly using graph theory where plethora measures exist context centrality measures structural information order identify important nodes network Bonacich Indicative measures betweenness centrality PageRank Another employs propagation models which specify actions propagated across social network Kempe example these actions could retweets Twitter Finally several methods combine content structural information social works alters PageRank order favor certain users according topic recently Katsimpras proposed supervised random approach towards topic sensitive influential nodes Recently Biran started explore characte ristics communication influence detection adopting

linguistic tools order extract morphosyntactic structure Analysis identifying influencers challenge development hybrid system merging linguistic linguistic descriptors large usually ensured taking account linguistic information already demons trated results linguistic information detection influencers relies assumption influencer specific behavior which translates linguistic terms recent

extracted machine learning model which allow scoring users based their influence state Random Forests mainly their ability leverage linear interactions among features their interpretability Visualization visualization module based which allows straight forward accessi bility Specifically segment social users according terms topics interest which allow grained influencers course global
