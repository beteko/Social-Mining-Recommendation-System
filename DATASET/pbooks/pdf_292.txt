sightseeing Visualization hotspots reveals interests which important industries tourism marketing research Although several social based techniques extracting hotspots independently proposed hotspot relation other hotspots cases organize those hotspots propose method detect visualize relations among hotspots proposed method detects assesses relations shooting spots photographic subjects proach extracts relations using hotspots which split hotspot includes photographs different types demonstrate approach discovering relations using photographic metadata photograph entation photograph locations Flickr Introduction According increasing popularity mobile devices digital cameras smart phones numerous photographs taken photographers uploaded photo sharing services Flickr Panoramio Recently those devices included embedded global positioning systems Using photographers readily photographs photographic metadata location photograph orientation information ticularly photographs photograph orientation feature become numerous recently Zheng addition photographs social media sites metadata annotated users through social tagging people might photographs subjects landscapes based their terests might upload those photographs social media sites locations which photographs taken these places might interesting places sightsee visit described paper define places hotspots Figure

relation shooting photographic subject described paper extract relations shooting spots photographic subjects Hirota define shooting hotspot where photographs taken direction interesting places landmark place distant there Extracting shooting spots social sites reveals attractive places tourists based activity addition range within which people photographs landmark important tourist attractions routing recommendation systems Therefore specifically examine extraction visualization relations between shooting spots photographic subjects hotspots social media sites Additionally extract relations using hotspots hotspot hotspot includes photographs different types split separate types hotspot example Figure around several areas apparent where photographs taken famous landmarks London famous giant Ferris wheel Thames River Hotspots extracted hotspot marked violet circle figure associated photographs taken London Therefore hotspots shooting spots landmarks extract relations
