content services according factors interest center location querying knowledge requirements nized profiles contexts profile encompasses metadata scribing whereas context groups information about environment interaction between system interesting problem there identify which profile significant given context paper proposes contextualization service which allows defining relationships between preferences contexts Further propose approach automatic discovery these mappings analyzing behavior extracted files Introduction Personalization paradigm adapting applications possible preferences context Adaptation concern several aspects system reconfiguration communication protocols sources selection query reformulation layout users feedback handling personalization refers techniques which allow providing users relevant content There exist approaches adapting customizing application interactions Centric Personalization Context Aware Application Considering previous approches satisfactory applica tions Indeed different profiles prefer listening during breakfast listening music while driving Alternatively different domains interest related hobbies allowing applications combine approaches leverages their adaptability benefit users paper through definition specific service called contex tualization Personalized Access Model operate profile context Given profile model

contexts achieve process propose takes input behavior captured files process divided three steps result partitioning mapping initialization context specificity check figure ABBAR Global profile contextualization process Notation Problem definition profile preferences preference composed predicate weight weight number expressing importance predicate predicate characterizes given concept triplet concept operator value Genre Drama context defined pairs attribute value location Paris consider context represented identifier contexts which interest application given whose profile profile contextualization consists specifying mappings which relates preferences contexts where mapping score respect context According value there three interpretations mapping positive mapping indicates predicate satisfied context negative mapping points predicates would satisfied context neutral mapping specifies predicate irrelevant context Mappings discovered analyzing historyH captured files profile contextualization process takes input contextualized profile history contexts handled given application returns mappings remaining section details steps process presented figure Result Partitioning first consists identifying which content liked which disliked phase produces containing respectively relevant contents irrelevant contents context following denote respectively relevant irrelevant contents context profile identification relevant irrelevant contents analyzing actions performed those contents Further relevance contents differ regard action applied example contextualization service bought product important given visualized spent propose organize possible actions relational table which describes actions their eventual weights Actions positive weights positive actions contents which performed considered being relevant whereas actions negative weights negative actions contents which applied considered being irrelevant Mappings initialization second consists initializing possible mappings between profile predicates contexts computing occurrence frequencies profile predicate respectively value depends whether frequency respectively satisfies given condition respectively instance threshold holds sufficient relevant results satisfies predicate positive mapping created Similarly holds negative mapping created satisfied neutral mapping created Finally predicate corresponds preference which always valid positive mapping created equal average frequencies union relevant irrelevant results Context specificity check prunes mappings which relate profile predicate contexts These mappings correspond discussed section concern profile predicates which contextualized considered contexts example watches movies English relevant results satisfy predicate language English irrelevant results icates taken account contexts corresponds general preferences result valid mappings between profile contexts Mapping construction algorithm Discovering automatically contextual preferences complex Therefore simplifying hypothesis design algorithm actions express positive preferences importance explained before algorithm takes input profile userH contexts threshold mapping validation algorithm compute frequency predicate context following value those frequencies mappings created predicate occurence frequency satisfies contexts positive mapping created attesting predicate holds contexts average frequencies apparition predicate always satisfied independently context characteristic ABBAR Algorithm Automatic mapping discovery Require profile behaviorH possible contexts threshold Ensure contextualization mappingsM Compute where pricj frequency predicate context predicate holds context predicate context predicate which context predicate holds contexts return occurence frequency given predicate satisfies neutral mapping created attesting predicate contextual other words predicate relevant contexts rarely occasionally predicates predicate frequent contexts predicate contextual Indeed relevant account contexts mappings created these context correspondent frequency ignore others where neutral mapping created remainder contexts
