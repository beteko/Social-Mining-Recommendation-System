Using Social Conversational Context Detecting Users Interactions Microblogging Sites BELKAROUI Aymen ELKHLIFI LARODEC Tunis University Tunis Tunisia belkaroui gmail LARODEC University Carthage Tunisia LALIC Paris Sorbonne University France aymen elkhlifi paris4 sorbonne Abstract current microblogging services Twitter gives ability communicate interact collaborate other reply messages others create conversations These services large information repository containing millions messages usually organized complex networks involving users interacting other specific times Several works proposed tools tweets search focused retrieve relevant tweets Therefore users unable explore results retrieve relevant tweets based content become frustrated information overload paper propose method retrieve conversation microblog sites particularly Twitter based content analysis content enrich method present informative result compared conventional search engine proposed method implemented evaluated comparing Google Twitter Search engines obtained promising results Introduction years People becoming communicative through expansion services multi platform applications blogs forums social networks which establishes social collaborative backgrounds behavior leads accumulation enormous amount information Among these platforms called microblogs Furthermore microblogging services gives people ability communicate interact collaborate other reply messages others create conversations While communicating people share different information common knowledge opinions emotions infor mation resources their likes dislikes analysis those communications commercial applications trends monitoring reputation management broadcasting addition characteristic microblogging services users limited produce contents involved indirectly conversations other Detecting Users Interactions Microblogging Sites users liking sharing posts Several works proposed tools tweets search focused retrieve relevant tweets Therefore users unable explore results retrieve relevant tweets based content become frustrated information overload addition finding results concerning given subjects needs consider entire context However context derived interactions paper proposed conversation retrieval method which extract versation twitter Comparing current methods proposed extract directly reply tweets relevant tweets which might retweets comments other possible interactions method extract extensive posts beyond conventional conversation document organized follows begin presenting related address conversation retrieval microblogging sites section propose method allows extracting content interactions experimentation evaluation results detailed section final section presents summary future dicrections Related Conversation retrieval search paradigm microblogging sites results intersection Information Retrieval Social Network Analysis microblog services provide retrieve relevant information Jabeur Cherichi ability provide tweets discussion There previous researches dealing specifically conversation detection addition existing conversation retrieval approaches microblogging sites Cogan Magnani focused particular conversation formed directly replying tweets Magnani proposed based model retrieving conversations microblogs considered tweets directly respond other tweets marker addressivity downside method consider tweets contain Similarly Cogan proposed method build conversation graphs formed users replying tweets tweet directly reply other tweet However users involved indirectly conversations communi commenting liking sharing posts other possible interactions Kumar authors concentrated different microblogging conversations aspects proposed simple model produces basic conversation structures taking account identities conversation member Other related works Huang focusing different aspects microblogging conversation respectively conversation tagging topics identification Twitter Conversation Detection Method TCOND propose method which combines conversational features directly exchanged messages order extract extensive posts beyond conventional conversation addition defined conversation short messages posted specific timestamp topic These messages directly replied other users using username indirectly liking retweeting commenting other possible interactions present details about approach steps Belkaroui Constructing Direct Conversation collect tweets reply directly other tweets Obviously reply always begin username create reply reply construction process consists algorithms parallel recursive finder algorithm iterative search algorithm Algorithm Recursive Finder twitter tweet collected Twitter tweet while Extract matching field reply status while twitter twitter first tweet published conversation single tweet conversation retrieved consider tweet tweet three types reply retweet Recursive Finder Algorithm identify conversation given algorithm starts known conversation established Iterative Search Algorithm remainder conversation searching tweets addressed using matching field reply status repeatedly until conditions indicating conversation ended Relevant Indirect Tweets define features detect tweets related indirectly conver sation extract tweets relevant conversation without symbol following notations sequel tweets present direct conversation tweets reply other tweets directly tweet linked indirectly conversation features Using sharing author would enrichment information published tweet feature applied collect tweets share contains otherwise Hashtags Similarity symbol called hashtag topic tweet follow conversation categorize follow topics hashtags feature collect tweets share hashtags Detecting Users Interactions Microblogging Sites contains hashtag otherwise Tweets Difference difference highly important feature detecting tweets linked indirectly conver sation attribute efficiently remove tweets having large distance terms compared conversation Tweets Publication dates attribute highly important detecting conversations Users tweets about conversational topic within short period Euclidean distance calculate similar posts publication dates Content compute textual similarity between element taking maximum value similarity measure between messages similarity between elements calculated using known cosine similarity Similarity Function Finally similarity between tweets indirectly linked conversation tweets which present reply calculated linear combination between their attributes Experiments Results following experiment designed gather knowledge impact results users experiment selected three events queried dataset using Google Twitter search engine method TCOND asked assessors results every search three relevance levels namely highly relevant value equal relevant value equal irrelevant value equal order measure results quality Normalized Discounted mulative judged events addition second metric which Precision dataset obtained monitoring microblogging system Twitter posts period August particular sample about posts containing trending topic keywords using Twitter streaming Trending topics determined directly Twitter selected frequent during monitoring period google Search twitter Belkaroui Experimental Outcomes Interpretation Results compare conversation retrieval method results returned Google Twitter search engine using metrics namely comparison obtained values summarized Table where notice method overcomes results given Google Twitter reason these promising values combine conversational features direct replies method retrieve conversation significant impact users evaluation Average Average Task1 Google Twitter TCOND Task2 Google Twitter TCOND Task3 Google Twitter TCOND Table Values Computing Worked Example Focusing three messages selections observe conversations obtained method receive higher scores compared Google Twitter selection According comments users following qualitative analysis posts three selections Google twitter received lower scores because contained posts judged interesting because posts considered relevant regard searched topic Concentration three messages selections observe conversations selections obtained twitter search higher scores respect Google selection These results toward general interpretation collected appears social metrics usage significant impact users degree interest retrieved posts addition retrieving conversations process Social Network differs traditional information retrieval involves human communication aspects degree interest conversation explicitly implicitly expressed interacting people Conclusion explored method detecting conversation microblogging sites formation retrieval activity exploiting conversational features addition directly exchanged messages retrieve conversation experimental results highlighted interesting points First including social features concept direct conversation Detecting Users Interactions Microblogging Sites search function improves relevance tweets informativeness provides sults considered satisfaction respect traditional tweet search Future further research conversational aspects including human communication pects degree interest conversation their influence popularity gathering multiple sources Social
