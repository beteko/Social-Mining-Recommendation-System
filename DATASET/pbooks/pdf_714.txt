France ismail elsayad martinet thierry urruty chabane djeraba Abstract Having effective efficient methods access desired essential nowadays amount digital images paper presents analogy between content based image retrieval retrieval analogy pixels letters patches words patches phrases groups patches sentences achieve document matching informative features including phrases tences needed improve these scenarios proposed approach based first constructing different visual words using local patch extraction scription After study different association rules between frequent words context local regions image construct visual phras which grouped different sentences Introduction typical Content Based Image Retrieval systems always important appropriate representation documents Baeza Yates Ribeiro Indeed quality retrieval depends quality internal representation content documents popular technique recently consists considering images words Grauman Jurie Djeraba Sivic Similarly document representation terms words domain words approach models image visual words which formed vector quantization local region descriptors words approach achieves results representing variable object appearances caused changes scale translation other discrimination power visual words leads correlations between image features semantics develop bodied global structure representation visual documents considering visual words introducing higher level representations namely visual phrases sentences approach extract scale orientation invariant local image patches image using Patches clustered different groups visual vocabulary Images divided vertical horizontal stripes define local regions where association learners discover patterns visual words occur frequently within these regions differ visual words strong association rules within these regions visual phrases constructed Finally neighbor phrases within stripe grouped tences Visual Sentence Phrase Based Document Representation Effective Efficient Based Image Retrieval Compared state techniques propose approach based visual words phrases sentences maintains different structural informa between local patches within local patches located image regions enriches presentation information gives better global structural representation whole image remainder article structured follows Section describe method constructing visual words images mining visual phrases visual words leads build visual sentences Section present image similarity based visual words visual phrases visual sentences Section concludes paper Image representation section describe three components chain processes constructing visual sentence phrase representation Figure information visual document representation Visual construction level feature

visual vocabulary database images different visual words located stripe returning definition association rules denotes items denotes transactions association relation expression where items properties characterize association rules holds transaction support transactions contains holds transaction confidence transac tions contain contain After mining whole transaction finding association rules association rules called strong support confidence above minsupport minconfi dence respectively Finally visual words within stripe involved strong association rules visual phrase example image after local patches squares extraction segmented different vertical horizontal stripes green lines Visual Sentence Phrase Based Document Representation Effective Efficient Based Image Retrieval Visual sentence construction visual phrases constructed process construct visual sentences grouping neighbor phrases within stripe structing visual sentences intrinsic advantage since visual sentence shared different objects within image gives representation structural tions between different objects which represented visual phrase Similarity matching retrieval Given proposed image representation Section
