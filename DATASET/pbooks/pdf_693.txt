Wunsch Clustering different objectives explore condense small representative points organise Segmentation ability recognise groups customers share similar needs McDonald customers broadly defined market needs therefore segmentation enables companies provide specific products services different segments clustering automatically provide segmentation recent performed objectives identify groups
