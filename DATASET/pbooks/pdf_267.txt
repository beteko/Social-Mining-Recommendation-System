Motivation Recently cloud systems through internet spread widely amount complex information easily quickly However hardly catch changes inside information disappear immediately whatever valuable often classify information classes which classes given advance class obtained through human recognition which imagine going using classes Since every class corresponds certain concept belongs class discuss multi label classification problem potential classes Multi class classification means process information multiple categories information category share common aspects which characterize category given advance called class label Automatic classification allows extract rules inductive learning examine collection histories attribute values labels called training extract features specific classes Kamber Research multi label classification initially motivated difficulty concept ambiguity encountered categorization every document belong several themes labels simultaneously document contains single label typical approaches probabilistic classification since traditional classification sults depend heavily training important there corpora although amount information label supervised
