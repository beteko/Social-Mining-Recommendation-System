LARODEC Tunisia Abstract Question answering systems directly return precise answers natural language questions Retrieving ranking passages viewed challenging tasks typical still require trivial effort paper propose novel approach retrieving ranking passages using grams based passage retrieval engine relies measure similarity between passage retrieved passages further ranked using Ranking model combining different similarity measures order return relevant passage given question experiments results shown promise demonstrated approach competitive Introduction years ongoing development information technology amount increasing massively every Thereby recent years witnessed burgeoning interest question answering which major research under Information Retrieval applications mainly Information Extraction Natural Language Processing where directly deliver precise concise answer question posted natural language sizable collection documents database Voorhees Indeed domain falls categories closed domain which deals questions under specific domain biology medicine domain which deals general questions various domains without limitation focus second category techniques tailored toward specific domain Basically typical broadly viewed pipeline which consists modules Tellex question analysis document retrieval passage retrieval answer extraction where module specific challenges particular passage retrieval always considered typical since allows reduce search space large collection documents fixed number passages Obviously cannot right response given question unless answer exists retrieved passages Therefore widely studied years ranking passages crucial pipeline which aspires order retrieved passages relevant Relevant Passage Retrieval ranking Approach Question Answering appear first purpose enhancing performance existing focus these tasks attempt increase number returned correct answers ensure their relevance paper propose approach retrieving ranking

ranked using Ranking model Joachims combining different similarity measures constitute features These latter include based measure other lexical semantic features which already proven successful Semantic Textual Similarity Buscaldi intent return relevant passage ranking relevant answer given question remainder paper organized follows Section overview related ranking tasks present Section proposed approach retrieving ranking passages Section devoted evaluating method order prove ability Section conclude paper outline perspectives Related Passage Retrieval Ranking Tasks Section review important approaches literature related categorized applied matching between candidate passages question proposed works ranking answer selection categorized according applied model Matching Types Passage Retrieval Indeed usually considered kernel typical numerous proaches developed purpose enhance performance Tellex performed quantitative evaluation different algorithms based lexical matching where deduced proposed algorithms process question independent symbol consider order terms their dependency relations order address shortcoming there several attempts consider dependencies Furthermore several works relied syntactic matching deriving syntactic relations match questions passages Nonetheless major limitation syntactic matching syntactic parser which available languages Added requires adaptation performance significantly depends performance analyzer Other works based semantic matching Ofoghi Yearwood Although allow genuine answers require semantic resources which usually available languages cover neither domains terms there further several works combining semantic syntactic techniques context Other works resorted different model retrieving passages going beyond above simple lexical matching These latter relied grams which refers sequences consecu words extracted given powerful terms independent symbols takes account simple dependency between Othman context Radev proposed probabilistic method based natural language where documents segmented passages which ranked using score based weighting addition Correa developed system based similarity measure favoring passages containing query grams longer compare candidate passages extracted words technique Buscaldi followed previous approach difference about model applied which considers passage grams existing question their proximity method retrieving passages different above based focus common grams between question passage proceed differently extract grams Indeed introduce similarity calculated weights question grams build total passage weight browsing question grams keeping weight fully found passage reducing weight divided smaller grams passage Ranking Approaches Answer Selection steps pipeline answer selection which starts ranking candidate passages provided module Given query expresses question ranking function orders retrieved passages relevant given query appear first several ranking models proposed tackle problem works relied models based knowledge sages Bilotti Araki Callan where knowledge about question answers named entity features represented annotation graph inferences derived knowledge Nevertheless major limitation knowledge based approaches number inferences manual features Besides mapping matching predicates arguments model relations remains complex Other works introduced approaches based patterns called templates which predefined context evaluation rules designed extracted question candidate passages often applied depending question instance Severyn applied learning models automatically learn complex patterns instance learning relational semantic structures which appear questions their passages However pattern based approaches complex require training Otherwise works context words simple intuition ranking passages latter authors proposed context ranking model named ranks retrieved passages using contextual information proper names syntactic patterns semantic features context window position predict whether given candidate passage relevant question However performance highly dependent question classification worth noting passage ranking model broadly inspired latter approach based which super vised learning model cases successfully applied passage ranking Moschitti Quarteroni Nonetheless resort Ranking model instead which incorporates features different those Unlike latter constrained neither words fixed window beyond simple detection class speech calculate lexical semantic similarity measures Relevant Passage Retrieval ranking Approach Question Answering Proposed Approach basic approach first reduce search space using grams retrieve passages likely answer question number returned passages state systems values close However since structure relies simple dependency between terms enough guarantee relevance Therefore retrieved passages using Ranking model combines additional lexical semantic similarity measures order return relevant passage ranking answer input question Section present approach retrieving ranking passages named which basically composed three modules question analysis passage ranking Figure depicts overall architecture proposed approach follows detail different constituents Global architecture approach Question Analysis Module intent question analysis generate formal query preprocessing question entered extracting useful terms query generated applying cleaning question words elimination tokenization words removal stemming query formally defined where denotes separate query represents number terms query Passage Retrieval Module Basically module composed principle components candidate passage extraction relevant passage extraction Subsection devoted detailing Othman Candidate Passage Extraction First index collection chopping documents paragraphs named sages related information document number extract terms eliminate stopwords Stemming applied easier search indexing passage formally defined where represents separate passage denotes number passage terms Thereafter frequency passage passage order compute maximum frequency weights passages indexed their terms stored inverted index order calculate weight query terms sorted formula employed Correa which consider frequency words takes account their discriminating power between passages passages contain least query terms query terms inverted index where related passages recorded intersection these passages candidate passages named defined where candidate passage number candidate passages weight candidate passage terms calculated query terms order filter candidate passages compute similarity between candidate passage question using following similarity measure siders words common between query passage candidate passages ranked according their similarity values number candidate passages reduced returned candidate passages ought reduce overall system complexity terms space enable deeper analysis which possible beforehand collec Hence number should fixed trying happy medium between small number order reduce system complexity without excluding passages contain answer misclassified example number apply another filter candidate passages using structures order extract relevant Relevant Passage Extraction until candidate passages returned previous number words common question Nevertheless criterion enough judge relevance passage Therefore necessary beyond simple verification occurrences Within context proposed methodology exploit other selection criteria presence sequences their length their dependence purpose technique which ensures simple dependency between terms ambiguity reduction language independence amount heterogeneity methodology extracting relevant passages consists following parts Generation first identify common terms between given question construct vector common terms between question passage browse through terms question check Relevant Passage Retrieval ranking Approach Question Answering passage vector latter defined where common between question passage denotes number question terms represents position question position passage number terms passage Thereafter construct vectors question vector passage browsing vector grouping terms having successive positions question passage Weighting weight question calculated basis length weights according terms where number terms contained question Indeed multiplication weights length favor adjacent words rather indepen Obviously grouped words meaningful ambiguous separate words reasonable independent greater weight belongs passage grams weighted according their similarity degree grams question assign cumulative weight passage browsing through grams question either whole weight lower added weight passage precisely question found passage weight added cumulative weight divided smaller grams passage lower weight added cumulative weight lower weight fixed according number small grams noteworthy there three possible cases query passage grams query combining number passage grams query included passage grams weight passage browse through question grams cases exists passage additional weight calculated using following formula terms where length weight divided grams passage number these latter additional weight terms Similarity Measure passage similarity measure referred between passage question ratio between weight passage question order passages according values measure order return those having highest values weight passage cumulative mentioned above partial weights calculated added total passage weight Othman calculation corresponds verification occurrence question passage underlying weight given following formula terms where denotes number question grams weight question calculated according formula where number question terms weight question weight calculated using formula question number question terms since terms grouped together weight question weight passage calculate similarity measure which formula terms Obviously similarity maximum terms question grouped passage example consider following terms question those passage terms trade ammonium nitrate fertilizers hampered European Economic Community terms ammonium nitrate essential ingredient variety products intended fertil izers others explosives reason divergencies national provisions classification content European Economic Community regulations controlling marketing corresponding vector between given question passage ammonium nitrate fertilizers European Economic Community latter deduce ammonium nitrate fertilizers European Economic Community ammonium nitrate fertilizers European Economic Community example composed grams partial passage weights calculate first question divided
