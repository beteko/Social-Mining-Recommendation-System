Intelligence Versus Big Data Multidimensional data has traditionally primarily been used for Business Intelligence BI applications so it is interesting to check the similarities and differences between BI and Big Data We now define the two terms Interestingly the term Business Intelligence was coined in 1958 more than 56 years ago Here H P Luhn defined BI as “the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal” Luhn 1958 More recently in 2013 Gartner Group defined BI to be “an umbrella term that includes the applications infrastructure and tools and best practices that enable access to and analysis of information to improve and optimize decisions and performance” Gartner Group 2013 Thus we can conclude that optimizing your business using data is not a new idea The term Big Data is of course more recent although the first uses of the term seems to date back to the 1990’s Wikipedia defined Big Data to be “an all encompassing term for any collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process them using traditional data processing applications” Wikipedia 2014 So the data should be so “big” that it becomes “difficult” to do it the traditional way When defining what is means to be “big” the 3 V’s of Volume very large datasets Velo city data arriving very rapidly and Variety data of very different format and structure are well known However up to 6 extra V’s are also mentioned namely Veracity how much can we trust data Visibility data must be visible to the Big Data processes Variability the meaning of data changes over time place context Viability can our data be used for any thing useful Value what real value can this data add to our business and Visualization complex visualization is needed to fully understand and get value Now we can finally compare BI and Big Data The following issues are similar for the two concepts and thus not novel for Big Data — Collecting integrating and analyzing data to gain knowledge — Large data volumes — Data often arrives at a fast pace Certainly the first item is what BI was always all about Traditional data warehouses have also held very large and increasing amount of data and the concept of real time data streams has 3 Managing Big Multidimensional Data been known for more than 15 years However there are also quite a few interesting differences between the two summarized in Table 1 The change is perhaps best illustrated by the picture that in BI were are “sipping data on a straw” whereas with Big Data data is coming right at us from a garden fire hose BI Big Data Data types Structured mostly Unstructured also Data sources Mostly internal Mostly external History Essential Often less relevant Users Manager controller Data scientist Precision Exact results Approximate results Privacy Not critical Critical Control over data Almost full control Little or no control TAB 1 – Differences between BI and Big Data Whereas BI data are mostly structured data from relational databases Big Data contains new data types such as text multimedia social network graphs etc The BI data sources were almost entirely internal to the organization e g ERP or CRM systems whereas Big Data such as social network updates originate entirely outside the organization and the external data is often the most important In BI keeping the full history of e g a customer is essential whereas with Big Data it is mostly not possible or even relevant to keep the history as the meaning of many concepts e g hashtags evolve quickly over time The main users of BI systems are classical company profiles likes controllers managers etc while Big Data is mostly used by the brand new job type of data scientists which mix deep statistical computer science machine learning and domain skills In BI systems computing the exact result e g an amount down to 4 decimal points is the norm whereas approximate results may be the only meaningful option for Big Data since the available data is only a sample of the full reality anyway In the company internal world of BI privacy us not a big issue whereas it becomes critical in the world of Big Data with people often revealing more about themselves on the social media than they want to Finally the perhaps most profound difference is the level of control in the traditional BI world the organization has more or less full control over the data whereas for the external Big Data the organization has little or no control Références Gartner Group

analytical business intelligence tools for decades However the standard data models and system implementations OLAP for multidimensional databases cannot handle “Big Multidimensional Data” very large amounts of complex and highly dy namic multidimensional data that occur in a number of emerging domains such as energy transport logistics as well as science This talk will discuss similarities and differences be tween traditional Business Intelligence BI and Big Data present examples of Big Multidi mensional data with the characteristics of large volume high velocity fast data and or high variety complex data and discuss how to manage Big Multidimensional Data including mod eling algorithmic implementation as well as practical issues 5 Conférences invitées Managing Big Multidimensional
