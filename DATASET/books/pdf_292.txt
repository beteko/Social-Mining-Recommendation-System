at which many photographs have been taken might be in teresting places for many people to do sightseeing Visualization of hotspots reveals user interests which is important for industries such as tourism and marketing research Although several social based techniques for extracting hotspots independently have been proposed a hotspot has a relation to other hotspots in some cases To organize those hotspots we propose a method to detect and visualize relations among hotspots Our proposed method detects and assesses relations of shooting spots and photographic subjects Our ap proach extracts the relations using sub hotspots which are split from a hotspot that includes photographs of different types We demonstrate our approach by discovering relations using photographic metadata such as tags photograph ori entation and photograph locations from Flickr 1 Introduction According to the increasing popularity of mobile devices such as digital cameras and smart phones numerous photographs taken by photographers have been uploaded to photo sharing web services such as Flickr 1 and Panoramio 2 Recently those devices have included embedded global positioning systems GPSs Using them photographers can readily take photographs with photographic metadata such as location and photograph orientation information Par ticularly photographs with a photograph orientation feature have become numerous recently Zheng et al 2011 In addition many photographs on social media sites have metadata that are annotated by users through social tagging Many people might take photographs of subjects such as landscapes based on their own in terests Then they might upload those photographs to social media sites As locations at which many photographs have been taken these places might also be interesting places for many peo ple to sightsee or visit As described in this paper we define such places as hotspots Figure 1 flickr com 2 panoramio com 167 Visualizing Shooting Spots using Geo tagged Photographs from Social Media Sites Big Ben London Eye Hotspot FIG 1 – Examples of hotspots 1 presents examples of hotspots extracted using our proposed method from photographs taken around Big Ben In this figure black polygons represent the areas of extracted hotspots Some methods have been proposed to extract hotspots from data from photographs at photo sharing sites Crandall et al 2009 Kisilevich et al 2010 Shirai et al 2013 Hirota et al 2014 The extracted hotspots might reflect people’s interests or be useful for marketing research spatial analysis and so on Analyzing such places is important for industries such as those related to tourism Sengstock and Gertz 2012 Kisilevich et al 2010 Furthermore tourist attraction recommendation systems such as Lu et al 2010 Popescu and Grefenstette 2011 can use this approach By presenting hotspots to people who visit a city for the first time our approach assists tourism Although many methods to extract and visualize hotspots from social media sites have been proposed those studies visualize the user interests but they do not specifically examine those relationships Crandall et al 2009 Kisilevich et al 2010 Shirai et al 2013 Therefore we extract relations among hotspots Hotspots in past studies are extracted independently but some hotspots are related However extracting and visualizing the relations among hotspots is important to organize hotspots and to find the nature of hotspots For example in Figure 1 around Big Ben in London hotspots were extracted from inside of Big Ben and around Big Ben Photographs taken around Big Ben have been taken in the direction of Big Ben There fore those hotspots have some relation to the shooting spot and the photographic subject As described in this paper we extract such relations of shooting spots and photographic subjects 168 M Hirota et al We define a shooting spot as one type of hotspot in an area where photographs have been taken in the direction of interesting places such as a landmark at a place that is distant from there Extracting shooting spots from social sites reveals attractive places for tourists based on user activity In addition the range within which people are able to take photographs of a landmark is important for tourist attractions and routing recommendation systems Therefore in this pa per we specifically examine extraction and visualization of relations between shooting spots and photographic subjects of hotspots from social media sites Additionally we extract the relations using sub hotspots A sub hotspot is a hotspot that includes photographs of different types It is split to separate types of hotspot For example in Figure 1 around Big Ben several areas are apparent where photographs have been taken to famous landmarks Big Ben and the London Eye a famous giant Ferris wheel near the Thames River Hotspots are extracted from this area The hotspot marked by a violet circle in this figure is associated with photographs taken of both Big Ben and the London Eye Therefore the hotspots are shooting spots for both landmarks To extract relations from the shooting spot to each landmark we must split a hotspot to sub hotspots based on the landmarks Therefore we split a hotspot into sub hotspots using social tagging and extract relations The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents works related to this topic Section 3 presents a description of our proposed method to calculate relations of photographic subject and shooting spot using photograph orientations photograph locations and social tagging Additionally we describe sub hotspots from extracted hotspots using social tagging Section 4 explains several examples of our proposed system and presents a discussion of the results Section 5 concludes the paper with a discussion of results and future works 2 Related Works 2 1 Extraction of hotspots from photo sharing sites Some methods have been proposed to extract hotspots from the many photographs that are available on photo sharing sites Those methods use density based clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN Ester et al 1996 to extract hotspots from a huge photograph dataset Cran dall et al presented a method to extract landmarks and hotspots using a clustering technique based on many geo tagged photographs available from the internet Crandall et al 2009 In addition Kisilevich et al proposed a method to extract a hotspot using the density of photo graph locations based on clustering results Kisilevich et al 2010 These methods treat each hotspot as independent However some hotspots are related to other hotspots such as photo graphic subjects and shooting spots Shirai et al proposed a method to extract a hotspot and to calculate the relation of hotspots Shirai et al 2013 To discover a wide area of interest this approach infers the relation among hotspots based on the photograph location and orientation However other relations among hotspots might exist such as shooting spots and photographic subjects Additionally although those studies extract hotspots from social media sites they do not consider contents of the hotspots As described in this paper we detect sub hotspots based on social tagging from a hotspot for extracting relations of the photographic subject and shooting spot among sub hotspots to consider photograph orientation 169

Visualization based on photograph orientation According to photographs with a photograph orientation have become more commonly available photograph orientation is used for extracting hotspots Lacerda et al proposed a method for extracting hotspots using photograph orientations Lacerda et al 2012 This method calculates the intersections between lines of photographic orientation of many pho tographs The intersections are clustered using DBSCAN In addition Thomee et al proposed a method for consideration of inaccuracies affecting GPS location measurements Thomee 2013 We regard this approach as effective for extracting photographic subjects but this ap proach has a limitation of extracting areas in which photographs have been taken as hotspots In addition current GPS data merely identify the location at which the picture was taken Most cameras are not equipped with sensors to measure the orientation As a result to extract hotspots the approach of using photograph orientation is not applicable for the area where huge photographs have been taken Therefore we apply a clustering algorithm based on pho tograph locations to extract hotspots In the related literature some methods to estimate the photograph orientation have been presented even for photographs that appear to have no photograph orientation Park et al 2010 Huang et al 2012 Our method uses the photographs with photograph orientation to extract relations Therefore we expect to use the estimated photograph orientation to increase the accuracy of our method 3 Proposed Method We propose a method to detect the relations of photographic subjects and shooting spots using photograph orientation location and social tagging Therefore we use photographs for which the obtained result includes information related to the photograph orientation location 170 M Hirota et al and tags We present an overview of our approach in Figure 2 To detect the relations of shooting spot and photographic subject our approach includes the following steps 1 For a particular area we obtain vast numbers of photographs from Flickr 2 We apply a grid based clustering algorithm to the obtained photographs based on pho tograph locations to extract the places at which many photographs have been taken as hotspots 3 Using extracted hotspots we cluster tags of photographs based on their geometric dis tribution we use extracted clustered tags to divide the extracted hotspots to different sub hotspots 4 Calculation of the relevance of sub hotspots using hotspot location and orientation to extract the relation between the shooting spot and the photographic subject We describe details related to the respective steps below 3 1 Extraction of hotspots To identify hotspot places at which many photographs have been taken we specifically examined the number of photograph locations to find those locations where photographs are taken by many people To achieve this we map photographs that have a photograph location to a two dimensional grid Those photographs are mapped to the coordinates as follows y = Mheight − Lat − Latmin Mheight Latmax − Latmin 1 x = Mwidth − Lng − Lngmin Mwidth Lngmax − Lngmin 2 Here Lat represents the latitude of the photograph GPSLatitude in Exif Lng is the longitude of the photograph GPSLongitude in Exif Latmax Latmin Lngmax and Lngmin respec tively denote the maximum and minimum values of Lat and Lng Additionally Mheight and Mwidth are the height and width of the grid This is decided using a parameter d for adjust ment that how many cells we want to make in this procedure Consequently each cell in the obtained grid includes a photograph taken in the range Using the obtained grid we extract the cells for which the number of photographs includ ing its cell is greater than threshold minP The nearby extracted cells which are mutually connected cells are joined Each group of joined cells is defined as a cluster To extract hotspots from the obtained grid we apply the Axis Shifted Grid Clustering al gorithm Chang et al 2009 to the obtained grid This clustering method is density grid based clustering with an axis shifted partitioning strategy to identify areas of high density An im portant benefit of this method is the dynamic adjustment of the size of the original cells in the grid and reduction of the weakness of borders of cells by shifting the original grid in each dimension of the data space after the clusters generated from this original grid are obtained The procedure of Axis Shifted Grid Clustering includes the following steps 1 Extraction of clusters by the method using the procedure described above This clus tering is denoted as C1 171 Visualizing Shooting Spots using Geo tagged Photographs from Social Media Sites ben big ben clock eye london eye wheel shard skyscraper bridge railway station train stone ceiling museum river Thames tower TAB 1 – Examples of clustered tags 2 The grid used for extracting C1 is transformed The grid is shifted by half of the distance d 2 in each dimension To obtain new clustering results the procedure for extracting clusters is applied again to the shifted grid This new shifted clustering result is denoted as C2 3 Clustering result C1 is revised using C2 We find each overlapped cluster in both clustering results where C1a ∩ C2b ̸= ∅ C2b ∈ C2 and C1a ∈ C1 C1 is modified by joining the extracted overlapped clusters Consequently the final clustering result includes C1 ∪ C2 Finally each extracted cluster is defined as a hotspot Each hotspot includes photographs of the cluster 3 2 Clustering tags to make sub hotspots After extracting hotspots from photographs we split each hotspot into sub hotspots be cause a hotspot often has several photographs taken in the direction of the photographic sub ject Therefore for this study we infer sub hotspots for each subject from such a hotspot based on tags that photographs have When we make sub hotspots we organize similar tags that rep resent the same meanings into clusters such as “big ben” and “ben” Photographs with each clustered tag in a hotspot might reveal one aspect of the meanings associated with the hotspot To organize similar tags we cluster social tagging using hotspot feature vectors based on geo spatial feature vectors Zhang et al 2012 The different types of tags of photographs have different geographical distributions The geo spatial feature vector of a tag is represented by a geo bin which includes cells in a grid having the number of photographs with the tag As a result the dimension of the vector is extremely large However the grid obtained from photographs with tags is sparse Therefore to decrease the computational cost we calculate the feature vectors using extracted hotspots instead of geo bins To compute a geo feature vector for tagi we count the photographs with tag which were taken in an area of hotspot h as U g t We count the users who applied a tag within a hotspot instead of the photographs Thereby we prevent high activity users from biasing the distribution Ahern et al 2007 Then we apply L2 normalization to the vector to calculate the geo bin vi t of tag t as follows vi t = U g t √∑|H| j=1 U 2 j t 3 Here |H| is the number of hotspots extracted in Section 3 1 It was described in an earlier report Zhang et al 2012 that this L2 normalization functions better Therefore we use the same method After geo feature vectors of each tag are calculated we cluster tags based on the similar ity of geographical distributions using hierarchical agglomerative clustering Then we use a 172 M Hirota et al method for calculating the distance between clusters Furthermore for stopping agglomerative steps we use a criterion parameter the minimal cluster distance is greater than the criterion Examples of clustered tags are presented in Table 1 Finally we define a subset of photographs with tags of a cluster in i th hotspot hi as a sub hotspot hsi of hi h s i includes photographs that have one tag of the s th cluster or more 3 3 Extraction of relations of shooting spot and photographic subject To extract relations of shooting spots and photographic subjects we calculate the relevance of extracted sub hotspots based on geometric location If photographs in sub hotspot hsi were taken to photographic subjects included in hsj then h s i is a shooting spot of h s j Those sub hotspots have a relation between hsi and h s j To confirm the orientation of h s i to h s j features of three types are used distance orientation and ratio of photographs First we calculate the Hubeny distance between hsi and h s j because photographs related to the shooting spot might have been taken near a hotspot that includes a photographic subject The Hubeny distance ds i j is calculated as ds i j = √ M dP 2 + N cos P dR 2 4 Therein P signifies the average latitude of centroids of hsi and h s j Also dP and dR respec tively represent the differences of latitude and longitude of centroids of hsi and h s j M stands for the radius of curvature for a meridian N is a radius of curvature for a prime vertical Next we ascertain whether the orientation of photographs in sub hotspot hsi to h s j h s i might be a shooting spot for taking photographs of subject in hsj if many photographs of h s i face the direction of hsj Therefore we calculate the degree of orientation of h s i to h s j First we calculate the main orientation of hsi We split the values of photograph orientation of h s i by 20 deg and counted the photographs of each class We use metadata GPSImgDirectionRef or GPSImgDirection in Exif as the photograph orientation The max class mdsi is the main orientation of hsi We calculate the average of those classes if the number of max classes is greater than one Next we calculate the orientation of ldsij from centroid x1 y1 of h s i to centroid x2 y2 of hsj as ldsij = tan −1 cosy2 sin x2 − x1 cosx1 siny2 − siny1 cosy2 cos x2 − x1 5 The degree o i j s of orientation of hsi to h s j is calculated as os i j = |mdsi − ldsij | 6 We calculate the ratio of photographs of hsi and h s j This feature is used to avoid the case in which another shooting spot is located at the middle of shooting spot hsi and the photographic subject in hsj Avoiding this case is difficult based on previously described features In the area of photographic subjects such as a landmark people have taken many photographs inside or nearby The number of photographs in the shooting spot for the subject is roughly the same or less than the extracted sub hotspot from the area The ratio rs i j of photographs of hsi and hsj is calculated as rs i j = |hsj | |hsi | 7 173 Visualizing Shooting Spots using Geo tagged Photographs from Social Media Sites Big Ben London Eye Trafalgar Square Charing Cross a b c d e f g h i j Relation Hotspot Landmark FIG 3 – Relation for Big Ben London dataset Big Ben London Eye a b c d e f g h i j Trafalgar Square Charing Cross Relation Hotspot Landmark FIG 4 – Relation for London Eye London dataset Therein |hsi | and |hsj | is the number of photographs of hsi and hsj Finally we calculate the relevance from rels i j to hsi and h s j as rels i j = √ ds i j os i j 1 rs i j 8 The smaller value of rels i j is the strong relevance from hsi to h s j Here we eliminate the relation from the hotspot of photographic subject to another hotspot Therefore we detect the hotspot that includes photographic subjects from extracted hotspots on s th clustered tags As described herein we define the hotspot collected relation from many other hotspots as a hotspot that includes a photographic subject The hotspot of a photographic subject is more than |rels| 0 5 where ||rels| is the number of relations on s th clustered tags We visualize relation rels i j as less than the adjustable threshold on Google Maps 3 4 Experiments This section presents a description of experiments conducted using our proposed method We present and discuss several examples of detection of relations of shooting spots and photo graphic subjects Photographs for experiments are obtained from photographic search results of Flickr Those photographs have Exif metadata of latitude GPSLatitudeRef GPSLatitude longitude GPSLongitudeRef GPSLongitude tags and timestamps Figures 3 and 4 present results of relations of shooting spots and photographic subjects in the area of Big Ben and the London Eye We used 1 123 550 photographs taken during 3 s google co jp maps 174 M Hirota et al 1 January 2010 31 June 2014 and taken in London latitude 0 450439 0 148315 and longitude 51 301643 51 669361 The clustering parameters are set as d = 200 and minP = 20 In those figures the black polygon shows the place extracted as a hotspot The arrowed line shows the relation The arrow points to a hotspot of the shooting spot to another hotspot of a photographic subject Here no difference exists between colors of those lines This is only an easy to view representation In addition in those figures several famous places and landmarks exist in this area Big Ben orange point the London Eye red point Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross green point Figure 3 shows the many hotspots with arrowed lines to the hotspot that includes Big Ben In hotspots connected by lines the hotspot that includes Big Ben d in Figure 3 has pho tographs taken around Big Ben Others a−c e−g in Figure 3 have photographs taken in the direction of Big Ben For example hotspots of b include the seven photographs taken to 60 120 deg where 0 deg is north increasing with clockwise rotation Here lines between some hotspots such as i and j and hotspot d were not drawn Those hotspots include photographs of Big Ben but few photographs among those have no orientation metadata Therefore we can not calculate the relations between those hotspots In addition using the features of distance orientation and ratio the relation from hotspot f to d is extracted appropriately For example if we extract relations among those hotspots based on the distance between hotspots or orien tation the relation of hotspot f is extracted as facing hotspot e Our method extracted the rela tions between the shooting spot and photographic subject using three features Additionally in Figure 4 the two hotspots d and f have arrowed lines to hotspot h Why some hotspots have no relation to hotspot h is the same reason as that of the number of photographs with orienta tion metadata as described previously Hotspot f has two types of photographs taken to Big Ben and the London Eye The place of hotspot f is a shooting spot to take those landmarks Furthermore for comparison to Figures 3 and 4 in shooting spots and photographic subjects hotspots h and d are interchanged based on what relation on a subject we extract Therefore splitting hotspots to sub hotspots based on social tagging and then extracting the relations of each type of photographic subject is important Next we emphasize the effectiveness of combining three features distance orientation and the ratio of the number of photographs Here we show the results of relations of shooting spots and photographic subjects obtained from another dataset of photographs taken in New York We used 1 300 315 photographs taken during 1 January 2010 31 June 2014 and taken in New York latitude 40 700422 40 804324 and Longitude 74 028454 73 929577 The clustering parameters are set as d = 500 and minP = 50 Figures 5 6 7 and 8 show extracted hotspots and relations around the Brooklyn Bridge as orange and Manhattan Bridge as white in those figures The relations in Figure 5 were extracted based on three features of Equation 8 In addition the relation in Figures 6 7 and 8 were extracted based on each feature Figure 5 shows many hotspots related to hotspot b in which the center of the Brooklyn Bridge exists These results show that those places are shooting spots for taking photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge In Figure 6 based on photographic orientations it is apparent that some hotspots have a relation to different hotspots such as hotspots a and g compared to Figure 5 However indeed many photographs taken in those hotspots are taken in the direction of the center of the Brooklyn Bridge The one reason why relations extracted based on the orientation are taken in the direction of a hotspot might be the error of orientation metadata measured using GPS Additionally if any metadata are measured inaccurately in terms of 175 Visualizing Shooting Spots using Geo tagged Photographs from Social Media Sites a b c d e f g h i Relation

occur Because of those gaps and because of the inaccuracy of measurement we think that extracting relations based only on orientation is inadequate Furthermore in Figure 7 hotspots show a relation to a closer hotspot As a result a relation by which photographs were taken to the Brooklyn Bridge or Manhattan Bridge is not extracted In Figure 8 all hotspots have relations to hotspot b However hotspot c in Figure 5 has a relation to hotspot h because hotspot c includes photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge but more photographs of Manhattan Bridge Therefore to extract relations of the shooting spot and photographic subject those features which are applied to hotspots are not feasible Results show that our method based on the combined features extracts relations effectively 5 Conclusions We proposed a method to extract and visualize the relation of a shooting spot and a pho tographic subject using photographs with location information related to photo sharing sites 176 M Hirota et al We extract hotspots of places where many photographs have been taken Then we split the ex tracted hotspots into sub hotspots based on geometric distributions of social tagging To calcu late the relations our approach uses photographic orientation positional relations of hotspots and the ratio of the number of hotspots We presented some examples of results obtained from Flickr using our method In several cases our methods were sufficient to detect and visual ize the relations of shooting spots and photographic subjects Additionally we discussed the availability of using three features to extract relations Future studies will be conducted to estimate metadata such as photographic orientation and social tagging to increase the number of photographs with metadata The applicability of our approach depends on the number of photographs that have metadata and their accuracy There fore we will estimate the metadata to photographs without metadata using other photographs with metadata Additionally we will recommend travel routes considering shooting spots be cause we think that places from which people can take photographs of famous landmarks are important for tourism References
