guille edmundo soriano morales} univ lyon2 fr Computer Science dept University Politehnica of Bucharest ciprian truica cs pub ro Abstract Each year the EGC conference gathers researchers and practitioners from the knowledge discovery and management domain to present their latest advances This year’s edition features an open challenge that encourages partic ipants to leverage the EGC rich anthology which spans from 2004 to 2015 The ultimate goal is to highlight the dynamics of the conference history and to try to get a glimpse of the coming years In this context we first describe our method ology for inferring latent topics that pervade this corpus using non negative ma trix factorization Based on the discovered topics and other properties of the articles e g authors affiliations we shed light on interesting facts on both the topical and collaborative structures of the EGC society Secondly we employ a hypergraph itemset extraction process to discover existent but latent relations between authors or between topics We also propose topic author and author author recommendations with a content based approach Lastly we describe a Web interface for browsing this collection of articles complemented with the discovered knowledge 1 Introduction In this article we describe work done in the context of the first edition of the EGC chal lenge which ultimate goal is to highlight the dynamics of the conference history and to try to get a glimpse of the coming years Dataset Participants of the challenge are provided with the descriptions of 1935 articles pub lished by RNTI out of which 1041 are articles presented at the EGC conference Each article is described by several fields year title abstract potentially missing list of authors and a URL pointing at the first page of the article potentially missing or unreachable When it is possible we enrich the descriptions of the articles with i the language detected from their abstracts and ii the authors’ affiliations Language detection relies on a naive Bayes classi fier trained on Wikipedia articles covering French and English using n grams of characters as features Cavnar and Trenkle 1994 The identification of authors’ affiliations relies on regular expressions to match e mail addresses in the content of the first page of the articles assuming 383 Topic modeling and hypergraph mining to analyze the EGC conference history TAB 1 Dataset statistics Type of articles Count approx proportion Articles for which the abstract is available 896 86% Articles for which the first page is available 936 89 9% Articles for which the detected language is French 817 78 5% Articles for which affiliation are known 893 86% that the domains of these addresses allow identifying institutions Tab 1 gives some statistics about this dataset Main results and organization of the paper In Sec 2 we present results based on latent topics discovered from the content of the articles’ abstracts We find that the scope of the EGC conference is evolving through time notably to incorporate novel interesting issues We also find that even though most of the works presented at the conference emanates from the academia the industry is very active on some targeted issues Furthermore we observe that authors have different ways of collaborating inside a topic or across topics and also that some authors are highly specialized on a topic whereas others are kind of generalists In Sec 3 we show the results for two recommendation approaches hypergraph based mining and content based recommendation We find that the recommendations suggested make sense according to the topics each author works with We also observe that there are certain research domains that seem to be interesting to develop Additionally we show interesting recommendations for highly published and new coming authors at EGC In Sec 4 we describe a Web interface for exploring the anthology complemented with the extracted knowledge 2 Topical structure of the EGC conference The purpose of this section is to shed light on some interesting facts about the EGC con ference based on its topical structure We begin by describing our methodology for inferring latent topics from the abstracts of the articles before analyzing these topics in details 2 1 Methodology Preparing the articles To avoid language specific topics and because EGC is mainly a French speaking conference we choose to consider only articles which abstract is written in French In order to improve the quality of the discovered topics we lemmatize the abstracts For that we use MElt a maximum entropy Markov model based part of speech tagging sys tem especially designed for French Denis and Sagot 2012 and Lefff a morphological and syntactic lexicon for French Sagot 2010 to match {word part of speech} pairs with lem mas In addition we prune lemmas which absolute frequency in the corpus is less than 4 as well as lemmas which relative frequency is higher than 80% with the aim to only keep the most significant ones Eventually we build the vector space representation of these articles with tf · idf weighting It is a n × m matrix denoted by A where each line represents an article with n = 817 i e the number of articles and m = 1739 i e the number of lemmas 384 A Guille et al 20 40 0 55 0 6 0 65 0 7 Number of topics St ab ili ty FIG 1 Weighted Jaccard average stability measure for a number of topics varying be tween 5 and 50 higher is better 20 40 0 1 0 2 Number of topics D iv er ge nc e FIG 2 Symmetric Kullback Liebler diver gence for a number of topics varying between 5 and 50 lower is better Choosing a topic model Given the matrix A and a small number of topics k k � m a topic model consists in two matrices W andH W is a n×k matrix that describes the articles in terms of topics and H is a k × m matrix that describes topics in terms of words More precisely the coefficient wi j defines the importance of topic j in article i and the coefficient hi j defines the importance of word j in topic i We consider two candidate methods for topic modeling i Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA a probabilistic generative topic model proposed by Blei et al 2003 and ii Non negative Matrix Factorization NMF a vector space factorization method which has recently became popular for topic modeling Berry and Browne 2005 It should be noted that we use variational inference for LDA and a projected gradient method for NMF Estimating the optimal number of topics Determining an appropriate value of k is critical to ensure a pertinent analysis of the EGC anthology If k is too small then the discovered topics will be too vague if k is too large then the discovered topics will be too narrow and may be redundant To help us with this task we compute two metrics First we compute the metric proposed by Greene et al 2014 which is based on the assumption that a model with an appropriate number of topics is more robust to missing data Given a value of k it assesses the stability of the discovered topics for several models fitted to sub samples of the original data The stability is measured in terms of the average weighted Jaccard distance between the ordered sets of words describing the topics Thus the higher the stability the closer k is to a suitable value We also compute the metric proposed by Arun et al 2010 which is based on the assumption that the distribution of the singular values of H is close to the distribution of row L2 norm of W when k is close to an optimal number of topics This metric is defined as the symmetric Kullback Liebler divergence between these two distributions which means that the lower the divergence is the closer k is to a suitable number of topics 2 2 Results We find that LDA and NMF identify very similar topics in this corpus with a slight advan tage for NMF in terms of topic separability Guided by the two metrics described previously we manually evaluate the quality of the topics identified with k varying between 15 and 20 385 Topic modeling and hypergraph mining to analyze the EGC conference history TAB 2 Descriptions of the discovered topics Topic id Most relevant words

respectively plot the stability based and divergence based metrics for k ∈ [5 50] using NMF Eventually we judge that the best results are achieved with NMF for k = 15 Table 2 lists the most relevant words for each of the 15 topics discovered from the articles with NMF They reveal that the people who form the EGC society are inter ested in a wide variety of both theoretical and applied issues For instance topics 8 and 12 are related to theoretical issues topic 8 covers papers about model and variable selection and topic 12 covers papers that propose new or improved learning algorithms On the other hand topics 0 and 6 are related to applied issues topic 0 covers papers about social network analysis and topic 6 covers papers about Web usage mining In the following we leverage the discovered topics to highlight interesting particularities about the EGC society To be able to analyze the topics supplemented with information about the related papers we partition the papers into 15 non overlapping clusters i e a cluster per topic Each article i ∈ [0 1− n] is assigned to the cluster j that corresponds to the topic with the highest weight wij as formalized in Eq 1 clusteri = argmax j wi j 1 Shifting attention evolving interests Fig 3 shows the frequency of topics 0 social network analysis and mining and 2 association rule mining per year from 2004 until 2015 The frequency of a topic for a given year is defined as the proportion of articles among those published this year that belong to the corresponding cluster This figure reveals two opposite trends topic 0 is emerging and topic 2 is fading over time While there was apparently no article about social network analysis in 2004 in 2013 12% of the articles presented at the conference were related to this topic In contrast papers related to association rule mining were the most frequent in 2006 12% but their frequency dropped down to as low as 0 2% in 386 A Guille et al 0 0 05 0 1 200420062008201020122014 Year Fr eq ue

connected component FIG 4 Order of the collaboration network and or der of the largest connected component for each topic 2014 This illustrates how the attention of the members of the EGC society is shifting between topics through time This goes on to show that the EGC society is evolving and is enlarging its scope to incorporate works about novel issues Collaborations across topics with few collaborators per topic Fig 4 shows the order i e number of nodes of the 15 topic wise collaboration networks and the order of the largest connected component in each of these networks Given a topic the nodes of the collaboration network represent the authors of papers assigned to the related cluster Edges connect pairs of authors who co wrote one or more papers assigned to this cluster We observe that all collaboration network are made of lots of small connected component mostly cliques except for the collaboration network constructed from papers assigned to topic 4 pattern mining which mainly consists in a large connected component The average proportion of authors in the largest connected component in the topic wise collaboration networks is about 0 16 0 74 for topic 4 whereas the proportion of authors in the largest connected component in the global network i e made of all the collaborations with no consideration for topics is about 0 47 This indicates that authors tend to collaborate with different set of authors across different topics Mostly academic research intense industrial research on targeted issues Fig 5 shows the number of articles per institution

coefficient measured for the 88 authors mentioned above It shows that there are few generalist authors with most of the authors having a skewness between 1 and 2 which roughly corresponds to a distribution with two major topics 3 Recommendations The following section describes the methodology we use to propose author author topic topic and author topic recommendations We employ two different approaches on the one hand we consider the interactions between authors as transactions and extract latent frequent itemsets using a hypergraph based mining method The itemsets discovered can indeed be seen as recommendations On the other hand we directly make recommendations based on 388 A Guille et al a bipartite graph and using classical item similarity measures Both approaches are described below 3 1 Background Hypergraph based mining We aim to find interesting relations between authors To that end we follow the hypergraph based item discovery method proposed by Liu et al 2011 The goal is to find frequent itemsets between authors or topics not based on their support frequency of apparition but on their similarity as measured by the Average Commute Time ACT distance Fouss et al 2007 It is our intuition that close authors related by their topics and years of publication are good candidates to work together in the future The ACT distance a random walk based vertex distance has the advantageous property of decreasing when the number of paths connecting two nodes increases and when the length of the paths decreases In this experiment we work with the complete EGC French corpus in order to possibly find a recommendation for each author in the dataset Content based recommendation This type of recommendation uses attributes to describe items which are then proposed to the users In our case the users are the authors and the items are the previously found topics which are indeed discovered by leveraging the words used in the author’s articles We use an item similarity recommendation system Ricci et al 2011 to suggest authors and topics for each author Briefly given an author our model suggests ranked topics according to their similarity to the topics observed for the author in question Through the similarity between said topics we can also find the most similar authors for each author 3 2 Methodology 3 2 1 Hypergraph mining Filtering authors The first step we follow is to build a list of authors from the EGC French anthology From the 817 articles we drew a list of 1307 individual authors We could have kept only the first appearing authors of each paper assuming that they contributed most of the writing Nonetheless the author name placement is a policy particular to each research labo ratory that may or may not represent the amount of contribution to the submitted manuscript Still we do filter the authors according to their number of publications Creating the hypergraph incidence matrices We want to influence the similarity between a pair of authors according to their shared topics and to their co occurrent years of publication Our intuition is that two authors may work together if they share similar topics and if both are active authors during a similar period of time In order to account for these two characteristics we build two hypergraph incidence matrices An author topic incidence matrix that links au thors with topics and an author year incidence matrix which describes the relation between authors and their respective articles’ years of publication The author topic incidence matrix is created by defining authors as vertices rows and topics as hyperedges columns Each cell contains 1 if the corresponding author is represented by any of the 15 topics else it contains 0 In this setting authors are first represented by their articles and these are depicted by the list of topics found in Section 2 Thus each author is 389 Topic modeling and hypergraph mining to analyze the EGC conference history indirectly represented by a set of topics It is clear that an author might not be represented by all the topics found thus it is important to determine the degree of influence of each topic according to the weight assigned by the topic model Thus for a given author and for each of her papers we first give more importance to those topics with higher weight or probability and then we select those topics that appear several times across the author set of papers The chosen topics are used to represent each author in the author topic incidence matrix As said before we want to influence the similarity between authors by considering the years they have published in The author year matrix has authors as vertices rows and the EGC French anthology years from 2004 to 2015 as hyperedges Each cell contains 1 if the corresponding author published in any of the mentioned years It contains zero otherwise Building the SCT similarity matrix In order to take into account the information from both incidence matrices described before we compute a square ACT similarity 1 matrix with authors as rows and as columns for each incidence matrix Finally both matrices are joined into a single similarity matrix SCT by averaging both matrices into one Finding the frequent 2 itemsets Once the similarity matrix SCT is computed we can de termine couples of related authors by setting a threshold on the similarity value between each of them If the threshold is exceeded that is two authors have a similarity higher than the fixed threshold we consider both of them as a frequent authors’ itemset and thus a possible co working recommendation Finding the best parameters Measuring the performance of recommendation systems is complex and can be subjective As a measure of performance for the author author relation mining we set to maximize the ratio α defined as the number of real articles written by the mined interesting pairs of authors divided by the total number of pairs found Our system has three tunable parameters i θ the minimum similarity value in the SCT matrix to consider a couple of authors as related ii γ the minimum number of publications an author should have and iii λ the number of topics that describe each author To find the best possible α ratio we start a grid search using the following range of values for each parameter θ = {0 5 0 55 0 6 0 95} γ = {3 4 5 9} and λ = {2 3 4 15} 3 2 2 Content based recommendations In this approach we want to study two specific groups of authors the veteran and the newcomer group Veteran authors are the top ten researchers with the highest number of publi cations Newcomer authors are those researchers that have two or more publications and began participating in the EGC conference since 2012 Our goal is to offer to each researcher in these groups a set of recommendations with whom it would be interesting to collaborate with For the veteran authors it may allow them to diversify and enlarge their research domain For the newcomer writers a clear map of who is working in similar topics at a relatively close level may help to improve their academic careers At the very least these recommendations can help make networking easier during the conference itself We show the recommendations for these authors in the form of recommendation graphs below 1 Given that ACT is a distance we transform it into a similarity metric by normalizing and subtracting from one 390 A Guille et al Filtering authors and representation We find the authors belonging to the veteran and newcomer groups by applying the filters described above Each authors is represented by the top five topics sorted by their weight as determined by the NMF or LDA approach that best describe them At this point we create a bipartite graph between authors and topics connected by weighted edges the weights being the same described before Recommending authors and topics To recommend topics to authors our model first builds a similarity matrix between topics using the observations of authors described by their related topics Then it scores a topic t for author a using a weighted average over the past observations of a that is the topics already used by a In a similar fashion the model recommends authors to authors by ranking them according to their similarity using the topics shared between them Choosing optimal parameters and best similarity measure The parameters of this tech nique are two γ which as above is the minimum number of publications and λ the number of topics that describe each author A similarity measure is needed to relate authors with other authors or with topics We test three types of similarity measures that Jaccard Pearson and cosine similarities Experimentally we found that the cosine similarity is the best performing while maximizing the real collaboration’s ratio described in the previous approach 3 3 Results Hypergraph author author mined relations After running the grid search to find the opti mal parameters for the author author recommendation we found the maximal value α = 0 33 that is one third of the found predictions exists already in the EGC anthology The values of the parameters are θ = 0 65 γ = 8 and λ = 2 In this setting 37 authors are considered and 9 predictions exceed the θ threshold The mined relations between authors are shown in Table 3 The three relations already existing in the EGC anthology are shown in bold According to our experiments we find that those names are indeed close according to the words shared by their representative topics Hypergraph topic topic mined relations In order to propose topic topic recommendations that is which two topic domains could work together according to the authors involved in both of them we simply transpose the author topic matrix described above in paragraph 3 2 1 and directly calculate the similarity matrix SCT We use the same parameters found in the previous section except for the number of topics describing each author λ which was set to 5 to avoid a singular matrix during the computations The results are shown in Table 4 In general the recommendations suggest the intersection of semantic Web technologies with non structured data such as images and text documents Recommendations for newcomer and veteran authors In Fig 9 we can see the top three suggestions for the 10 veteran authors We keep the recommendations only between the vet eran authors themselves Fig 10 shows the top three recommendation graph for the newcomer authors We decided to keep all the newcomer writers that satisfied our thresholds in order for it to be useful to the newcomer researchers In both figures the thicker links describe a collab oration that has already happened The gray links define the proposed associations We use 391 Topic modeling and hypergraph mining to analyze the EGC conference history TAB 3 Couples of authors discovered with the hypergraph mining approach sorted by their
