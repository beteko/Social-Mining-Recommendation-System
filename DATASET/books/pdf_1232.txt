précisément XLive est un médiateur tout XML développé à PRiSM Il permet d'exécuter des XQuery sur des sources de données hétérogènes Après une rapide présentation de XLive et du Web sémantique une architecture à trois niveaux d'ontologies et de schémas est introduite pour connecter des adaptateurs pour le Web sémantique Cette architecture vise à intégrer des sources de type Web service d'information conformément à une ontologie globale de référence Elle conduit à étendre XLive avec le support de vues un outil de conception de vues et de mappings et des adaptateurs pour les Web services 1 Introduction Typical information integration systems have adopted a wrapper mediator architecture [Wiederhold 1992] In this architecture mediators provide a uniform user interface to query integrated views of heterogeneous information sources Wrappers provide local views of data sources in a global data model The local views can be queried in a limited way according to wrapper capabilities While in the 90's most studies were based on using the object model as data integration model the focus has come to XML as global model at the beginning of the new century Mediator architects are used to distinguish the local as view LAV approach versus the global as views GAV approach in which the integrated views are designed in terms of the local views of sources To meet a given ontology in a given domain the LAV approach seems more appropriate but the GAV approach makes easier to take into account existing data sources schemas Thus mixed approaches are possible supported by schema design tools [Haas 1999] Well known research projects and prototypes in mediation include Garlic [Haas 1999] Tsimmis [Garcia Molina 1997] Tukwila [Ives 1999] ] Artemis [Castano 2000] Enosys EXIP[Papakonstantinou 2003] and XLive [Dang Ngoc 2003] a descendant of e XML mediator [Gardarin 2002] Tim Berners Lee the inventor of the WWW thought up the Semantic Web The goal is to give well defined meaning to Web information better enabling intelligent Web applications requiring searching or reasoning make them exchange meaning rather than information There are a lot of sometimes confusing activities at W3C along this line The most prominent results are RDF RDF Schema RDFS and OWL Web Ontology Language RDF provides a semantic data model based on triple <resource property value> Mediating the Semantic Web RNTI E 2 to describe Web resources [RDF 2002] RDFS brings a data typing model for RDF Using RDF Schema the users can specify types of resources create properties and classes with sub classes as well as defining ranges and domains for properties OWL is a language to develop ontologies [OWL 2003] An ontology defines a common vocabulary to share information in a domain It includes formal definitions of concepts in the domain and relations among them In practical terms OWL includes constructs to define classes subclass–superclass hierarchies properties and values plus constructs to define constraints and rules between classes and properties The problem addressed in this paper is how to query the semantic Web using a mediation architecture In the XLive project we have developed a full XML mediator to query semi structured data sources including relational databases mapped in XML and XML files stored in Xyleme a warehousing system for XML [Abiteboul 1999] We are currently extending the XLive mediator to query and integrate Web services We assume that each site provides a Web service API to retrieve Web pages First using an extractor we built a local view of the site as a collection of XML documents that can be queried on certain elements Then based on several layers in general 2 of ontologies we define integrated views of sources in a given domain e g tourism Accordingly to the classification of [Wache 2001] we implement a hybrid approach where the semantics of each source is described by its own ontology and the semantics of integrated data is defined by some domain ontology Each ontology is associated to an XML view defined in XQuery of the extracted data This paper is organized as follows In section 2 we recall some backgrounds on XQuery and XML mediation then we describe the XLive mediator We focus on the XLive architecture and metadata management In section 3 we recall some backgrounds on the semantic Web introducing OWL and Web Services which are strong foundations for the XLive project In section 4 we introduce the XLive extensions for querying the semantic Web These are mainly the introduction of ontological views the development of Web service wrappers and a design toolkit for mapping views to ontologies and vice versa 2 XML Mediation Mediation technology based on XML and XQuery is under development Some products are already available We survey this new technology and describe our XLive mediator see xquark org for an industrial open source version 2 1 Basics and Backgrounds With the advent of XQuery as a standard for querying XML collections [XQuery 2003] several mediator systems have been developed using XQuery and XML schema as pivot language and model Examples of full XML mediators are the Enosys XML Integration Platform EXIP the Software A G EntireX XML Mediator the Liquid Data mediator of BEA derived from EXIP [Papakonstantinou 2003] the e XMLMedia XML Mediator a predecessor of our current XLive project [Gardarin 2002] XML Mediators are focusing on supporting the XQuery query language on XML views of heterogeneous data sources The data are integrated dynamically from multiple information sources Queries are used as view Georges Gardarin et al RNTI E 2 definitions During run time the application issues XML queries against the views Queries and views are translated into some XML algebra and are combined into single algebra query plans Sub queries are sent to local wrappers that process them locally and return XML results Finally the global query processor evaluates the result using appropriate integration and reconstruction algorithms XQuery is a powerful language which encompasses SQL and much more Notably it is able to query rich and extensible data types it is a functional language so that any valid expression applied to a valid expression is a valid query it will soon incorporate XQuery Text for full text queries XQuery Text shall provide functionalities as single word search phrase search support for stop words search on prefix postfix infix proximity searching word normalization diacritics ranking and relevance All that features will make XQuery an ideal language for querying the semantics Web XQuery mediators are interesting components to perform semantic integration of Web information Web mediators aim at transferring Web information from different Web sites in the same domain e g tourism to a high level domain specific common information model making document semantic machine understandable Web mediators should integrate three kinds of advanced technologies ontology based description of Web sources Web data extraction and mapping and distributed query processing based on mediators 2 2 Overview of the XLive Mediator In the XLive project we use a mediation architecture to support web information integration and semantic search as shown in Figure 1 It follows the classical wrapper mediator architecture as defined in [Wiederhold 1992] The communication between wrappers and mediator follows a common interface which is defined by an applicative Java or Web service interface named XML DBC With XML DBC requests are defined in XQuery and results are returned in XML format Web Interface Java Application Java Application RDB1 Oracle RDB2 MySQL XML DB3 Xyleme Wrapper Wrapper Wrapper Mediator Mediator Mediator FIG 1 XLive Architecture Mediating the Semantic Web RNTI E 2 Our architecture is composed of mediators that deal with distributed XML sources and wrappers that cope with the heterogeneity of the sources DBMS Web pages etc The XLive mediator is a data integration middleware managing XML views of heterogeneous data sources Using XLive mediator one can integrate heterogeneous data sources without replicating their data while the sources remain autonomous XLive mediator is entirely based on W3C standard technology XML XQuery XML Schema SAX DOM and SOAP All information exchanges rely on XML format XML Schema is used for metadata representation Wrappers provide schemas to export information about local data structures XQuery is employed for querying both the mediator and the wrappers Connectivity of mediator and wrappers relies on the XML DBC programming interface an extension of JDBC to integrate XQuery More information about the XLive mediator can be found in [Dang Ngoc 2003] To integrate a new source into the mediation architecture a wrapper must be built It has to implement the XML DBC programming interface process some XQuery requests and return results in XML format DBMS are data oriented sources and metadata are provided to describe sources and mappings DBMS wrappers translate data sources in XML and process a possibly reduced set of XQuery on the source data In the case of Web source the wrapper brings more intelligence It aims at semantically integrating Web information in a common model accessible to programs 2 3 Metadata in the XLive Mediator The XLive mediator maintains metadata in a simple way Each time a source connects to a mediator it provides the structural tree of the XML documents it is able to retrieve More precisely a mediator maintains the set of XML paths that can be queried and retrieved from each wrapper it is connected to It is called the path set and can be seen as a weak schema or a summarizing DTD of the source Query processing uses the path set to check query validity and to determine the relevant data sources for a query The path set is also used to expand incomplete paths Skeletons of schemas can also be displayed to the final user in order to help him to formulate queries In the sequel we are going to discuss how to extend these metadata to meet ontologies 3 Semantic Web In this section we present some recalls on the Semantic Web We also discuss the link with Web Services 3 1 Basics and Backgrounds Let us start with a definition from W3C The Semantic Web is the representation of data on the World Wide Web It is a collaborative effort led by W3C with participation from a large number of researchers and industrial partners It is based on the Resource Description Framework [RDF 2003] which integrates a variety of applications using XML for syntax and URIs for naming RDF descriptions express semantic metadata over document Georges Gardarin et al RNTI E 2 contents Web pages etc using triplets <Resource Property Value> Resources located by URIs are described by properties and values a value being a resource or a literal RDF is used to annotate documents with semantic descriptions Descriptions are expressed in terms defined in ontologies An ontology is a definition of the concepts and relationships that exist for a domain It is generally expressed in terms of class hierarchies literal or class valued properties with formal rules linking the defined classes and properties e g class equivalence property transitivity etc [OWL 2003] Ontologies are definitions of metadata about data e g Web pages that can be used for reasoning RDF schema is a first level language to write definition of metadata in the RDF Vocabulary Description Language proposed by W3C When RDF metadata are based on an RDF schema RDF properties should reference the base RDF schema through a namespace RDF schema does not provide reasoning capabilities In addition an ontology includes reasoning capabilities about things that may help in understanding what computers are dealing with when processing information in search engine query systems mediation systems intelligent agents etc 3 2 OWL to Define Ontologies OWL Ontology Web language is a language to define ontologies on the Web based on RDF schema It extends the basic constructs of RDF schema to provide more interoperability e g equivalences more reasoning facilities e g description logic and more evolution support e g integration and version It is inspired from DAML DARPA and OIL EEC OWL incorporates the basic features of RDFS RDF Schema definitions of class property domain range sub class and sub property A property relates a class to a class or a literal The XML schema data types are supported for typing literal properties Individual can also be defined as member of a class In addition OWL provides constructs to define relationships between classes such as equivalence and set expressions e g A is B union C minus D Properties can also be qualified as functional symmetric or transitive two properties can be declared as inverse Cardinalities are extended and restrictions can be imposed to property values Finally versioning information and annotations e g comments can be defined for ontologies 3 3 Place of Web Services Web services are applications whose logic and functions are published on the Web in UDDI registries and accessed through standard XML messages encoded in SOAP A further step in the development of software components previous steps have been object component development as EJB or Active X Web Services represents abstract functions that can be reused without worrying about how the services are implemented The interface of a Web Service is defined strictly in terms of messages the service accepts and produces Applications using Web Services can be implemented on any platform in any programming language as long as they can create and consume messages defined for the service interface A Web Service can also be a composition of other services to provide higher level functionalities Language for composing and orchestrating Web Services are on their way towards standardization for example BPML BPEL BPSS Mediating the Semantic Web RNTI E 2 Web Services and the Semantic Web are complementary Web Services aim to standardize and automate the protocol to transmit requests and answers to active Web resources whereas the semantic Web aims to standardize and automate semantic descriptions of Web resources for information integration and reasoning The Semantic Web addresses the semantic description of the contents while the Web Services addresses the syntactic exchange of the contents Integrating Web services and the Semantic Web in a mediating architecture is another issue discussed below 4 Mediating the Semantic Web Several architectures of mediators have been proposed to query the Semantic Web We propose an hybrid architecture with ontologies defining vocabularies of schemas describing information This architecture is currently being implemented both as a schema design tool and runtime view support in the XLive project 4 1 Hybrid Mapping Architecture Overview Most Web mediators implement the LAV approach to design local source schemas as views of some pre existing global schema often called ontology There is often some confusions between a schema and an ontology In our view an ontology define concepts and relationships between concepts These concepts are used to annotate information and define conceptual view of information A XML schema defines the structures and types of document collections One of the problems for mediating the Web is to map generally poor schemas of documents to generally rich ontology and vice versa Most mediators work with schemas of collections not with ontological descriptions of information The latter superimpose conceptual schemas and constraints on information using ontology based annotations To integrate the Semantic Web in our mediator architecture we propose an hybrid mapping scheme where i Local sources are mapped to one or more local ontologies using a GAV approach local annotations elaborated in conformance to the source ontologies can be used to support the mapping ii Domain ontologies are mapped to local ontologies using a LAV approach annotations of local sources can also be added to help the mapping process We clearly distinguish schema describing view of information and ontologies giving set of concepts to annotate information and helping in building view We define all mappings in XQuery which is a powerful language to map information and annotations in an integrated way This is feasible as everything is XML and can be queried based on XQuery possibly with specific functions as allowed in XQuery Figure 2 gives an overview of the proposed schema and ontology architecture at the mediator layer A global ontology is defined in OWL A global ontological view corresponds to an integrated schema it defines a logical collection in terms i e with a mark up defined in the global ontology Semantic annotations can be added to the local view in terms of the global ontology Local views are derived from global views using XQuery following the Georges Gardarin et al RNTI E 2 LAV definition scheme Mapping from local ontological view instances to global ontological views is through an XQuery computed at design time as the inverse of the view definitions Global Ontological View Global Domain Ontology Local Ontological View 1 Local Ontological View 2 Local Ontological View 3… XQuery View Definition XQuery View Definition XQuery View Definition FIG 2 – View and Ontology at mediator layer Figure 3 gives an overview of the proposed schema and ontology architecture at the wrapper layer Local ontologies are also defined in OWL A local ontological view is defined by a path set and a query it corresponds to a logical collection expressed in terms defined in the local ontology Semantic annotations can be added to a Web site in terms of the local ontology Local ontological view instances are derived from local logical views and annotations using XQuery Local logical views instances are derived from Web Services calls or local source queries e g SQL queries Local Logical View Local Ontological View Semantic Annotation Local Ontology Local Ontology RDF Web Site XQuery Local Logical View Local Ontological View Semantic Annotation Local Ontology Local Ontology RDF Web Site XQuery FIG 3 – View and Ontology at wrapper layer Mediating the Semantic Web RNTI E 2 4 2 Wrapping Web Services as Local Logical Views Web sites become more and more open to Web services Good examples are Amazon com and Google They both provide a Web service API to query their catalogs While the Amazon catalog describes products Google catalog describes the World Wide Web sites With Google the main Web service operation is the search request It submits a query string and a set of parameters to the Google Web APIs service and receives in return a set of search results see Figure 4 Search results are XML documents derived from Google's index of over 2 billion Web pages They are composed of various elements the most important being an array of <ResultElement>'s each item giving a summary a URL a snippet a title a size the host name and some others information see Figure 5 FIG 4 Google query path set FIG 5 Google response path set Georges Gardarin et al RNTI E 2 To wrap Web services to an XQuery mediator it is necessary to define a representation of the Web service as one or more collections of XML documents The path set of the collection s should cover both the query string and the search results For simplicity we propose to define one collection per service operation modelling the invocation and response messages A collection derived from an operation holds a path set covering the DTDs of all documents that can be queried and retrieved using the operation For example Google search could be seen as a collection of path sets portrayed in Figure 4 and 5 Queries could then be submitted involving the collection using XQuery with text extensions as foreseen in XQuery Text We call that view of a Web service the local logical view defined as follows Definition Local Logical View Representation of a Web service function as a partially queryable collection whose path set is the set of paths defined in the function call and return messages The collection schema is derived from the WSDL service description All queries are not feasible on the local logical view Capabilities should be associated to the wrapper to define what queries are possible For example with Google search queries must instantiate the q element with some text search expressions to be valid Other elements can be given or generated by default In summary information searching Web services can be modelled as queryable collections corresponding to operation messages This simple mapping makes possible the translation of search XQuery in Web service invocation The mapping defines the virtual view of a Web service as a collection of XML virtual documents The translation of XQueries involving virtual collections in Web service invocation has to be developed on a per case basis depending on the Web service semantics 4 2 Mapping Web Service Views to Ontologies As described above any Web service can be wrapped as an XML collection that supports some more or less general XML queries This provides a simple way to map Web site to structural views defined as XML collections with associated path set In general for each site local logical views can be built that resembles the structure of the information source possibly encapsulated by Web services It provides a local XML schema to represent the source defined in local terms If it helps to extract data from the source using XQuery it does not help much to integrate the information of various sources with more or less different semantics Thus further mappings are required to provide an integrated view of the information Several working groups are currently defining ontologies in various domains as wine travel tourism health sciences and manufacturing Definition Global Ontology Definition of classes with properties developed by specialists of a given domain specifying a vocabulary of terms with their relationships Mediating the Semantic Web RNTI E 2 Unfortunately existing Web sites does not follow these global ontologies and have their specific models However to be able to integrate information coming from various sources of related topics it is necessary to use a common ontology at some point To make the source ontologies comparable to each other global shared vocabularies have to be built A shared vocabulary contains basic terms the primitives of a domain Each site should implement its local view of the common ontology that we call a local ontology Definition Local Ontology Projection on a local site of a global ontology defining the global classes and properties understood at a local site Local ontologies are defined for example in OWL and used to generate RDF descriptions of the associated source From a local ontology an XML path set can be derived describing the source as a collection of XML documents expressed in terms of the ontology This collection is called the ontological view of the source Definition Local Ontological View Representation of a local source as a set of partially queryable collections of documents whose path set is derived from the local ontology In general an ontological view is built using an ontology vocabulary Its path set is composed of elements defined in the ontology Its schema should be derived from the ontology This is also true for the integrated view defined as follows Definition Global Ontological View Representation of the integrated sources as a set of partially queryable collections of documents whose path set is derived from the global ontology As local ontologies are derived from the global one by projection it is natural to use a local as view approach to derive the local ontological view from the global one Thus we propose to define each local ontological view as one or more XQuery queries on the global ontological view In general we use XQuery to map the XML logical collections to a domain related ontology locally using a GAV approach and globally using a LAV approach This makes the mapping more flexible as clearly divided in two steps logical to ontological mostly corresponding to semantic integration and global to local mostly corresponding to localization integration Views and ontologies are summarized in Figure 6 4 3 Query Processing and Schema Design Tool The XLive architecture is currently being extended to meet ontologies XLive receives XQuery requests expressed on a simple integrated schema composed as the union of local views XLive decomposes queries according to the source path sets Local sub queries on local views are then shipped to local systems with respect to source capabilities To fully integrate the proposed ontology and view architecture XLive has first to be extended with view support on the mediator Second each local wrapper should be able to translate XQuery expressed on local ontological views to queries on local logical views which are finally translated to Web service calls Figure 7 shows query processing in the extended XLive Georges Gardarin et al RNTI E 2

Local ontological view schemas Global ontological view schemas Mappings from global ontological views to local ontological views then to local logical view The inputs of the design tool are the global ontology the WSDL description of Web services and semantic correspondence given by some administrator Correspondence may be defined by simple identity mappings using drag and drop but more complex mappings are possible using libraries of operations developed in XQuery for the application or generic Semantic annotations of local sources can be added to help in mapping development Figure 8 gives an overview of the envisioned design tool Notice that local and global designer components should collaborate in order to design the local ontological view as a compromise between the global ontological view and the logical view We are currently designing more precisely our design tool Local Designer Local Ontology Web Services Definitions Local Ontological View Local Logical View OWL

Gardarin et al RNTI E 2 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented XLive a mediation project developed at PRiSM in the context of the WebSI project The mediator is currently operational to support relational or XML sources coupled through specific wrappers We consider extending XLive to query the semantic Web using XQuery We summarize the contribution of the semantic Web Ontologies and description of Web site through annotations based on ontology have to be considered Web services must also be integrated Extending XLive with ontology and Web service is not an easy task It leads us to a hybrid architecture mixing top down and bottom up schema and mapping design More precisely we introduced three levels of views of Web services as collections of documents namely the local logical view the local ontological view and the global ontological views We defined clearly these three layers and discuss query processing and mapping design tool Further research is necessary to be able to use properly ontology in mediator based data integration We believe that XQuery is an excellent language both for expressing mappings and formulating queries Optimization techniques have to be developed to make the semantic Web mediator process efficiently all that mappings fortunately some mappings can be resolved at compile time More optimization techniques are discussed in [Dang Ngoc 2003] Finally we would like to point out that more than two levels of mapping could be supported to meet a global ontology This is possible thanks to the recursive architecture of XLive that makes possible to see a mediator as a local source Intermediate mediator can progress towards the vocabulary of a given ontology leaving upper layer mediator additional mappings to reach the desired

at PRiSM in the context of the WebSI European project XLive is decomposing global XQuery to local ones according to source capabilities After a short description of XLive and some recalls on the Semantic Web an architecture encompassing three levels of ontology based schemas is proposed It is a hybrid architecture integrating both the local as view LAV and global as view GAC approaches It allows the development of semantic Web wrappers and the progressive integration of sources according to global domain ontology Finally an extended XQuery mediator with view enrichment a mapping design
