 Parameter free association rule mining with yacaree José L Balcázar Departamento de Matemáticas Estadística y Computación Universidad de Cantabria Santander Spain joseluis balcazar unican es 1 Introduction Association rule mining is one of the most central aspects of data mining There are many implementations of association miners Borgelt 2003 Witten and Frank 2005 Zaki and Hsiao 2005 The problems faced in association rule mining are twofold First the quantity of candidate itemsets potentially leading to rules grows exponentially with the often already large universe of items The introduction of a support parameter was a key advance that allowed for the design of efficient frequent set miners and for the computation of association rules in large datasets there exploration is limited to those itemsets that appear “often enough” as subsets of the transactions that is their relative frequency exceeds a certain ratio of the transactions Agrawal et al 1996 Then the second problem is that often the set of rules provided as output is huge specially if we consider that its purpose is to be read by a human Many studies of notions of redundancy exist that limit the output to “irredundant” rules according to several existing notions of redundancy e g Zaki 2004 Kryszkiewicz 2001 but even taking redundancies into account the results are in many cases unsatisfactory high implication thresholds leave out many interesting rules whereas lower ones let pass far too many rules to be manually inspected Many alternative quality measures exist for association rules Geng and Hamilton 2006 Lenca et al 2008 Tan et al 2004 Our system yacaree Yet Another Closure based Association Rule Experimentation En vironment processes transactional datasets each transaction being an itemset and obtains irredundant rules X → Y where both X and Y can be arbitrary disjoint itemsets yet it does not require the user to select the value of any threshold parameter As in most current propos als we mine only frequent closed itemsets and apply known redundancy filters Our current closure mining algorithm is a simplified variant of ChARM see Zaki and Hsiao 2005 rather close to a depth first search As in some of the associators of Weka we mine closures in order of decreasing support see Witten and Frank 2005 However our algorithm is very different it requires no “delta” parameter for stepwise support threshold decrease as Weka’s “Apriori” does and does not relate support to confidence as “predictive Apriori” does Scheffer 2005 also present in Weka Instead we self adjust the internal effective support bound on the basis of technological limitations it starts at an almost trivial level and grows if necessary as the monitorization of the mining process reveals that the memory consumption surpasses internal thresholds The closures are passed on to a “border” algorithm which computes the lattice structure and then irredundant rules are extracted Parameter free association rule mining with yacaree Second we implement a novel implication quality process Our option is as follows we impose a very mild confidence threshold that remains fixed letting large quantities of rules pass but we control the number of rules to be provided to the user via a relative rather than ab solute confidence bound measured by the parameter called “closure based confidence boost” Balcázar 2010 related both to the lift and to the “support ratio” introduced in Kryszkiewicz 2001 without giving it a name as one of the properties used to accelerate a computation of the representative basis of association rules these connections are crucial for our system we use the approximation to the confidence boost provided by the support ratio to push the confi dence boost constraint into the mining process and we use the lift applied to particular cases where we can prove a strong connection with the boost to self adjust the boost threshold All our components are joined together through lazy evaluation using the functional pro gramming facilities of Python closures Hasse diagram edges predecessors of a closure and rules are obtained from iterators Closures and candidate rules are either discarded if we can guarantee that future threshold adjustments will never recover them or processed if they obey the thresholds or maintained separately on hold if they fail the current thresholds but might obey them after later adjustments Thus the memory expense is controlled by maintaining only those pieces of information that can be relevant for the current or future threshold values The result is a functional preliminary system where ample room still remains for efficiency and algorithmic improvements which shows that it is possible to find interesting association rules in a fully autonomous manner the user simply selects a dataset and launches the process which takes just one to five minutes in many easy datasets and up to ten to twenty minutes on a modern laptop for a few difficult highly dense datasets The output is a set of rules which in most cases is reasonably small and shows independent and sensible associations The screenshot provided in Figure 1 shows the simple interface button “Run” is disabled as the system has been just run and the two text files generated the log where we can see that the process took a bit over five minutes and the start of the file containing the rules found Both the console and the log indicate the self adjustments of the support no adjustment was performed on the boost threshold as enough high boost

program yacaree that mines irredundant association rules in usually reaso nable quantities yet it does not require the user to choose any value for any parameter Instead it fixes values for some parameters and runs a dataset driven self adjustment of the two main ones support and a variant of relative confidence studied recently by the present author
