de confirmer ces résultats 1 Introduction Networks are studied in numerous contexts such as biology sociology online social net works marketing etc Graphs are mathematical representations of networks where the entities are called nodes and the connections are called edges Very large graphs are difficult to analyse and it is often beneficial to divide them in smaller homogeneous components easier to handle The process of decomposing a network has received different names graph clustering in data analysis modularization community structure identification The clusters can be called com munities or modules in this paper we use those words as synonyms 1 This work is supported by REQUEST project between Thales and Paris 13 University 203 Comparison of linear modularization criteria using the relational formalism Assessing the quality of a graph partition requires a modularization criterion This function will be optimized to find the best partition Various modularization criteria have been formula ted in the past to address different practical applications Those criteria differ in the definition given to the notion of community or cluster To understand the differences between the optimal partitions obtained by each criterion we show how to represent them using the same basic formalism In this paper we use the Mathe matical Relational Analysis MRA to express six linear modularization criteria Linear criteria are easy to handle for instance the Louvain method can be adapted to linear quality functions see Campigotto et al 2014 The six criteria studied are the Newman Girvan modularity the Zahn Condorcet criterion the Owsiński Zadrozny criterion the Deviation to Uniformity the Deviation to Indetermination index and the Balanced Modularity details in section 3 The relational representation allows to understand the properties of those modularization criteria It allows to easily identify the criteria suffering from a resolution limit first discussed by For tunato et Barthelemy 2006 We will complete this theoretical study by some experiments on real and synthetic networks demonstrating the effectiveness of our classification This paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents the Mathematical Relational Ana lysis approach we introduce the property of balance for linear criteria and its relation to the property of resolution limit In Section 3 we present the six linear modularization criteria in the relational formalism Next Section 4 presents some experiments on real and artificial graphs to confirm the theoretical properties found previously 2 Relational Analysis approach There is a strong link between the Mathematical Relational Analysis 2 and graph theory a graph is a mathematical structure that represents binary relations between objects belonging to the same set Therefore a non oriented and non weighted graph G = V E with N = |V | nodes and M = |E| edges is a binary symmetric relation on its set of nodes V represented by its adjacency matrix A as follows aii′ = { 1 if there exists an edge between i and i′ ∀ i i′ ∈ V × V 0 otherwise 1 We denote the degree di of node i the number of edges incident to i It can be calculated by summing up the terms of the row or column i of the adjacency matrix di = ∑ i′ aii′ =∑ i′ ai′i = ai = a i We denote δ = 2M N2 the density of edges of the whole graph Partitioning a graph implies defining an equivalence relation on the set of nodes V that means a symmetric reflexive and transitive relation Mathematically an equivalence relation is represented by a square matrix X of order N = |V | whose entries are defined as follows 2 For more details about Relational Analysis theory see Marcotorchino et Michaud 1979 and Marcotorchino 1984 204 P Conde Céspedes J F Marcotorchino and E Viennet xii′ = { 1 if i and i′ are in the same cluster ∀ i i′ ∈ V × V 0 otherwise 2 Modularizing a graph implies to find X as close as possible to A A modularization cri terion F X is a function which measures either a similarity or a distance between A and X Therefore the problem of modularization can be written as a function to optimize F X where the unknown X is subject to the constraints of an equivalence relation 3 We define as well X̄ and Ā as the inverse relation of X and A respectively Their entries are defined as x̄ii′ = 1 − xii′ and āii′ = 1 − aii′ respectively In the following we denote κ the optimal number of clusters that means the number of clusters of the partition X which maximizes the criterion F X 2 1 Linear balanced criteria Every linear criterion is an affine function of X therefore in relational notation it can be written as F X = N∑ i=1 N∑ i′=1 φ aii′ xii′ +K 3 where the function φ aii′ depends only on the original data for instance the adjacency matrix In the following we will use K to denote any constant depending only on the original data Definition 1 Property of linear balance A linear criterion is balanced if it can be written in the following general form F X = N∑ i=1 N∑ i′=1 φ aii′ xii′ + N∑ i=1 N∑ i′=1 φ̄ aii′ x̄ii′ +K 4 where φ and φ̄ are non negative functions depending only on the original data and verifying ∑N i=1 ∑N i′=1 φii > 0 and ∑N i=1 ∑N i′=1 φ̄ii > 0 3 In fact the problem of modularization can be written in the general form Max X F X subject to the constraints of an equivalence relation xii′ ∈ {0 1} Binary xii = 1 ∀i Reflexivity xii′ − xi′i = 0 ∀ i i′ Symmetry xii′ + xi′i′′ − xii′′ ≤ 1 ∀ i i′ i′′ Transitivity The exact solving of this 0 − 1 linear program due to the size of the constraints is impractical for big networks So heuristic approaches are the only reasonable way to proceed 205 Comparison of linear modularization criteria using the relational formalism By replacing x̄ by its definition 1− xii′ equation 4 can be rewritten as follows F X = N∑ i=1 N∑ i′=1 φii′ − φ̄ii′ xii′ +K 5 From this expression we can deduce the importance of the property of balance for linear criteria If the criterion is a function to maximize the presence and or absence of the terms φii′ and φ̄ii′ has the following impact on the optimal solution — If φ̄ii′ = 0∀i i′ the solution that maximizes F X is the partition where all nodes are clustered together in a single cluster so κ = 1 and xii′ = 1 ∀ i i′ and F X =∑N i=1 ∑N i′=1 φii′ — If φii′ = 0∀i i′ then the optimal solution that maximizes F X is the partition where all nodes are separated so κ = N and xii′ = 0 ∀ i 6= i′ and xii = 1 ∀i therefore F X = ∑N i=1 ∑N i′=1 φ̄ii In other words the optimization of a linear criterion who does not verify the property of balance will either cluster all the nodes in a single cluster or isolate each node in its own cluster therefore forcing the user to fix the number of clusters in advance We can deduce from the previous paragraphs that the values taken by the functions φ and φ̄ create a sort of balance between the fact of generating as many clusters as possible κ = N and the fact generating only one cluster κ = 1 In the following we will call the quantity ∑N i=1 ∑N i′=1 φ aii′ xii′ the term of positive agreements and the quantity ∑N i=1 ∑N i′=1 φ̄ aii′ x̄ii′ the term of negative agreements 2 2 Different levels of balance We define two levels of balance for all linear balanced criterion Definition 2 Property of local balance A balanced linear criterion whose functions φii′ and φ̄ii′ satisfy φii′ + φ̄ii′ = KL ∀ i i′ where KL is a constant depending only upon the pair i i′ therefore not depending on global properties of the graph has the property of local balance Some remarks about definition 2 — Since KL depends only on properties of the pair i i′ that is local properties we call this property local balance — When we talk about global properties we refer to the total number of nodes the total number of edges or other properties describing the global structure of the graph — In the particular case of local balance where KL is constant ∀ i i′ that is φii′ and φ̄ii′ sum up to a constant we have the following situation whereas φii′ increases φ̄ii′ 206 P Conde Céspedes J F Marcotorchino and E Viennet decreases and vice versa Let us consider the special case where φ aii′ = aii′ the general term of the adjacency matrix A null model is a graph with the same total number of edges and nodes and where the edges are randomly distributed Let us denote the general term of the adjacency matrix of this random graph φ̄ aii′ A criterion based on a null model considers that a random graph does not have community structure The goal of such a criterion is to maximize the deviation between the real graph represented by φ aii′ and the null model version of this graph repre sented by φ̄ aii′ as shown in equation 5 That implies ∑N i=1 ∑N i′=1 φii′ = ∑N i=1 ∑N i′=1 φ̄ii′ = 2M This constraint implies that φ̄ii′ depends upon the total number of edges M Consequently the decision of clustering toge ther two sub graphs depends on a characteristic of the whole network and the criterion is not scale invariant because it depends on a global property of the graph The definition of null model for linear criteria can be generalized as follows Definition 3 Criterion based on a null model A balanced linear criterion whose functions φii′ and φ̄ii′ satisfy the following conditions N∑ i=1 N∑ i′=1 φii′ = N∑ i=1 N∑ i′=1 φ̄ii′ φii′ + φ̄ii′ = g KG ∀ i i′ where g KG is a function depending on global properties of the graph KG is a crite rion based on a null model KG can be for example the total number of edges or nodes We can deduce from definitions 2 and 3 that a linear criterion can not be local balanced and based on a null model at the same time In the particular case where φ̄ decreases if the size of the network increases it becomes negligible for large graphs As explained previously if this term tends to zero the optimization of the criterion will tend to put together the nodes more easily For instance a single edge between two sub graphs would be interpreted by the criterion as a sign of a strong correlation between the two clusters and optimizing the criterion would lead to the merge of the two clus ters Such a criterion is said to have a resolution limit The resolution limit was introduced by Fortunato et Barthelemy 2006 where the authors studied the resolution limit of the modularity of Newman Girvan They demonstrated that mo dularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on global characteristics of the graph even weakly interconnected complete graphs which represent the best identifiable communities would be merged by this kind of optimization criteria if the net work is sufficiently large According to Kumpula et al 2007 the resolution limit is present in any modularization criterion based on global optimization of intra cluster edges and extra community links and on a comparison to any null model 207 Comparison of linear modularization criteria using the relational formalism In section 4 we will show how criteria having a resolution limit fail to identify certain groups of densely connected nodes 3 Modularization criteria in relational notation Graph clustering criteria depend strongly on the meaning given to the notion of commu nity In this section we describe six linear modularization criteria and their relational coding in Table 1 We assume that the graphs we want to modularize are scale free that means that their degree distribution follows a power law 1 The Zahn Condorcet criterion 1785 1964 C T Zahn see Zahn 1964 was the first author who studied the problem of finding an equivalence relation X which best approximates a given symmetric relation A in the sense of minimizing the distance of the symmetric difference However the criterion defined by Zahn corresponds to the dual Condorcet’s criterion see Condorcet 1785 introduced in Relational Consensus and whose relational coding is given in Marcotorchino et Michaud 1979 This crite rion requires that every node in each cluster be connected to at least as half as the total nodes inside the cluster Consequently for each cluster the fraction of within cluster edges is at least 50% see Conde Céspedes 2013 for the demonstration 2 The Owsiński Zadrożny criterion 1986 see Owsiński et Zadrożny 1986 it is a generalization of Condorcet’s function It has a parameter α which allows according to the context to define the minimal percentage of required within cluster edges α For α = 0 5 this criterion is equivalent to Condorcet’s criterion The parameter α de fines the balance between the positive agreements term and the negative agreements term For each cluster the density of edges is at least α% see Conde Céspedes 2013 3 The Newman Girvan criterion 2004 see Newman et Girvan 2004 It is the best known modularization criterion called sometimes simply modularity It relies upon a null model Its definition involves a comparison of the number of within cluster edges in the real network and the expected number of such edges in a random graph where edges are distributed following the independence structure a network without regard to community structure In fact the modularity measures the deviation to independence As mention in the previous section this criterion based on a null model and it has a resolution limit see Fortunato et Barthelemy 2006 In fact as the network becomes larger M −→ ∞ the term φ̄ii′ = ai a i′2M tends to zero for since the degree distribution follows a power law 4 The Deviation to Uniformity 2013 This criterion maximizes the deviation to the uniformity structure it was proposed in Conde Céspedes 2013 It compares the num ber of within cluster edges in the real graph and the expected number of such edges in a random graph the null model where edges are uniformly distributed thus all the nodes have the same degree equal to the average degree of the graph This criterion is 208 P Conde Céspedes J F Marcotorchino and E Viennet based on a null model and it has a resolution limit indeed δ −→ 0 as N −→∞ 5 The Deviation to Indetermination 2013 Analogously to Newman Girvan function this criterion compares the number of within cluster edges in the real network and the expected number of such edges in a random graph where edges are distributed follo wing the indetermination structure 4 a graph without regard to community structure introduced in Marcotorchino 2013 and Marcotorchino et Conde Céspedes 2013 The Deviation to Indetermination is based on a null model therefore it has a resolu tion limit 6 The Balanced modularity 2013 This criterion introduced in Conde Céspedes et Marcotorchino 2013 was constructed by adding to the Newman Girvan modularity a term taking into account the absence of edges Ā Whereas Newman Girvan modula rity compares the actual value of aii′ to its equivalent in the case of a random graph ai a i′ 2M the new term compares the value of āii′ to its version in case of a random graph N−ai N−a i′ N2−2M It is based on a null model and it has a resolution limit Criterion Relational notation Zahn Condorcet 1785 1964 FZC X = N∑ i=1 N∑ i′=1 aii′xii′ + āii′ x̄ii′ Owsiński Zadrożny 1986 FZOZ X = N∑ i=1 N∑ i′=1 1− α aii′xii′ +

P̄ii′ = āii′ − N−ai N−a i′ N2−2M TABLE 1 – Relational notation of linear modularity functions 4 There exists a duality between the independence structure and the indetermination structure see Marcotorchino 1984 Marcotorchino 1985 and Ah Pine et Marcotorchino 2007 209 Comparison of linear modularization criteria using the relational formalism The six linear criteria of Table 1 verify the property of balance so it is not necessary to fix in advance the number of clusters more specifically General balance Criterion Local Balance Null model Comment Zahn Condorcet X φii′ + φ̄ii′ = aii′ +

Linear criteria From Tables 1 and 2 one can easily deduce that for the criteria having a resolution limit the quantity φ̄ii′ decreases when the size of the graph becomes larger 4 Tests with real and artificial networks We modularized six real networks of different sizes Jazz Gleiser et Danon 2003 Inter net Hoerdt et Magoni 2003 Web nd edu Albert et al 1999 Amazon Yang et Leskovec 2012 5 and Youtube Mislove et al 2007 We ran a generic version of Louvain Algorithm see Campigotto et al 2014 and Blondel et al 2008 until achievement of a stable value of each criterion The number of clusters obtained for each network is shown in Table 3 Table 3 shows that the Zahn Condorcet and Owsiński Zadrożny criteria generate many more clusters than the other criteria having a resolution limit for which the number of clusters is rather comparable Moreover this difference increases with the network size Notice that the number of clusters for the Owsiński Zadrożny criterion decreases with α that is the minimal required fraction of within cluster edges so the criterion becomes more flexible Only ground truth overlapping communities are defined on these previuos real networks This fact makes difficult to judge the quality of the obtained partitions That si why we genera ted five benchmark LFR graphs see Lancichinetti et al 2008 of different sizes 1000 5000 10000 100000 and 500000

Newman Girvan modularity the Deviation to Uniformity index the Deviation to Indetermination index and the Balanced Modularity This notation allowed us to easily identify the criteria suffering from a

Approximating symmetric relations by equivalence relations SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 12 840–847 Summary The modularization of large graphs or community detection in networks is usually ap proached as an optimization problem of a quality function or criterion for instance the mod ularity of Newman Girvan There exist other clustering criteria with their own properties leading to different solutions In this paper we present six linear modularization criteria in rela tional notation such as the Newman Girvan modularity Zahn Condorcet Owsiński Zadrożny the Deviation to Uniformity index the Deviation to Indetermination index and the Balanced Modularity We use a generic version of Louvain algorithm to approach the optimal partition of the criteria with real networks of different sizes We found that those partitions present important differences concerning the number of clusters The relational formalism allows us to justify these differences from a theoretical point of view Moreover this notation allows to easily identify the criteria having a resolution limit a phenomenon which causes the criterion to fail to identify modules smaller than a given scale
