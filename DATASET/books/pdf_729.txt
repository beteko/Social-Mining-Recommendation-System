recipient file where the X are the common variables and the Y are the specific ones The goal is to complete the recipient file X1 Ŷ1 in such a way that it can a be a realization of the joint density function f X Y There are three basic approaches for data fusion The first one consists of embedding the common and specific variables within a parametric multivariate distribution f X Y |θ assuming donors and receptors independently and randomly draw from this distribution This distribution can be factored into f X Y |θ = f Y |X θY |X f X θX hence it is possible to estimate its parameters θX and θY |X from the available information and use them to impute the missing block of data The second approach consists of directly modelling the relationship between the Y variables and the X variables in the donor file by means a regression function E Y |X = r X + ε and applying this model in the recipient file explicit modelling The last approach consists of finding for each individual of the recipient file one or more donor individuals as similar as possible and then in some way transferring the values of Y variables to the recipient individual implicit modelling This method is known as hot deck a term borrowed from data editing in data bases Validity of the imputation We will say that a data fusion is valid if the fused data set X1 Ŷ1 is an instance of the distribution function f X Y In general the distribution function f is unknown thus we are compelled to compare the empirical distribution functions ef X1 Ŷ1 with the ef X1 Y1 We call the discrepancy between both distributions matching noise following Paass 1985 the matching noise depends on the rightness of the imputation function i X to approximate instances of the joint true distribution which in the parametric case it depends on how well the assumed multivariate distribution represents the true data and in the hot deck methodology depends on as before the assumed imputation model i X and in addition to the existing discrepancies between the recipients and their corresponding donors However whatever the imputation method chosen imputed data is not like observed data since it has inherent uncertainty this is the uncertainty problem Imputed values Ŷ1 are estimates thus to be realistic we need to take into account the variability of the imputed data when analyzing it This variability comes from the random fluctuation of the distribution Assessing the uncertainty in knn Data Fusion f Y |X θY |X and also from the fact that model parameters θY |X are unknown and conse quently they also convey random fluctuation Multiple Imputation is the classical way to cope with this problem Rubin 2004 It consists of repeating several times the single imputation procedure from the predictive distribution of f Y |X θY |X under realistic conditions of the parameters θY |X and then just concatenate the several single imputation files Suite of validation statistics Aluja Banet et al 2007 ASLm comparison of

by the single imputation but it stands below the performances of the parametric multiple imputation except for the matching noise where the knn method assures realistic imputations References Aluja
