 Community Detection in Social Networks with Attribute and Relationship Data The Anh Dang Emmanuel Viennet L2TI Institut Galilée Université Paris Nord 99 avenue Jean Baptiste Clément 93430 Villetaneuse France {theanh dang emmanuel viennet} univ paris13 fr 1 Community Detection Algorithms We present two methods to discover communities in an attributed graph given a similarity measure An attributed graph is denoted as G = V E X where V is the set of nodes E is set of edges X = X1 Xd is the set of d attributes associated with the nodes in V Each node vi is associated with an attribute vector x1i x d i a Algorithm SAC1 In this algorithm we first define a composite modularity Q as an extension of Newman’s well known modularity function Clauset et al 2004 Q = ∑ C ∑ i j∈C α · 1 2m · Gi j − di · dj 2m + 1− α · simA i j α is the weighting factor 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 simA i j is the attribute similarity of the nodes i j To find an approximate optimization of Q we follow an approach directly inspired by the Louvain algorithm Blondel et al 2008 The algorithm starts with each node belonging to a separated community A node is then chosen randomly The algorithm tries to move this node from its current community If a positive gain is found the node is then placed to the community with the maximum gain Otherwise it stays in its original community This step is applied repeatedly until no more improvement is achieved The first phase is completed when there is no more positive gain by moving of nodes Next we can reapply this phase by grouping the nodes in the same communities to a new community node To determine the attribute similarity between two communities we propose two approaches The first is to sum up the similarity of their members the second way is to set to the similarity of their centroids b Algorithm SAC2 Our first algorithm SAC1 repetitively checks all nodes leading toO n2 complexity To reduce the computational cost we propose another approach that only makes use of a node’s nearest neighbors Given an attributed graph G = V E X we define a k nearest neighbor graph k NN Gk = V Ek as a graph in which each node has exactly k edges connecting to its k most similar neighbors in G The similarity measure between 2 nodes i and j is defined as S i j = α ·Gi j + 1− α · simA i j 515 Community Detection in Social Networks with Attribute and Relationship Data where simA i j is the attribute similarity function Gi j represents the link i j We ap ply the measurement S in the first place to construct the nearest neighbor graph The naive approach to build k NN graph uses O n2 time and O nk space However in literature sub stantial effort has been devoted to speed up the process We propose a simple algorithm with two phases constructing a k NN graph Gk Phase 1 and finding structural communities in Gk to obtain the final clustering Phase 2 In Phase 2 various methods can be employed to find communities In our experiments we choose Louvain as the detection method because of its scalability We set k equal to the average degree of the nodes in the graph G 2 Experimental results We perform experiments on several real social networks We extract the communities using different methods attribute based clustering random walks Louvain on unweighted graph Fast Greedy SAC1 SAC2 We compare the number of communities size of communities modularity structure modularity attribute density and entropy of the clustering Experimental results demonstrate that our methods provide more meaningful communities than conventional methods that consider only relationship information Références Blondel V D J L Guillaume R Lambiotte et E Lefebvre 2008 Fast unfolding of communities in large networks Journal of Statistical Mechanics Theory and Expe riment 2008 10 P10008 12pp Clauset A M E J Newman et C Moore 2004 Finding community structure in very large networks Physical Review E 70 066111 Summary In this paper we propose two methods that couple topological structure as well as attribute information in the detection of communities As future work we try to understand the roles of links and content information in the formation of online communities in order to devise adapted discovery strategies and to model the dynamic of the networks 516
