 Complex Information Processing Jacques Blanc Talon Responsable du Domaine Scientifique "Ingénierie de l’Information et Robotique" DGA DS MRIS France jacques blanc talon dga defense gouv fr Summary It is commonplace nowadays to claim that information is everywhere and that as a re sult finding the right information mathematically according to a set of criteria optimizing a specific goal is very difficult Defence applications have to cope with similar problems communication networks surveillance and information systems transmit and generate signifi cant amounts of complex information which cannot be processed with low level algorithms The challenge is to build high level processing units which demand a lot of computing po wer so as process video streams and communication packets with little possibility of a false alarm as automatically as possible Methods for processing aligning merging low level and high level information from syntactic to semantic information extracted from still images videos speech text and the Internet are being considered The framework includes theoreti cal approaches algorithms as well as evaluation methods Topics of interest are data fusion learning techniques data mining HCI even Artificial Intelligence Defence applications are numerous from scene understanding to weak signal detection Bibliography Jacques Blanc Talon is the Head of the Scientific Domain "Information Engineering and Robotics" at the Office for Advanced Research and Innovation MRIS at the DGA Direction Générale de l’Armement He is the Signal Processing Chapter Chair for IEEE France member of the GdR ISIS and at the Board of the SEE SI2D Club see viadeo com He is the cofounder and Chairman of the conference Advanced Concepts for Intelligent Vision Systems ACIVS acivs org
