stefan trausan cs pub ro Abstract Part of speech POS tagging is often used in other modules of nat ural language processing and therefore the results of this process should be as precise as possible Many different types of taggers have been developed to im prove the accuracy of the results in the field of literature or newspapers Nowa days when the internet is widespread the environments for online collaboration as chats forums blogs wikis have become important means of communica tion The purpose of this research is to analyse the results of tagging the words obtained from the labelling of the words from the online collaboration environ ments and literary texts with the corresponding parts of speech In the case of POS tagging the ambiguities arise due to the fact that a word may have multiple morphological values depending on context 1 Introduction Part of speech POS tagging is the process of grammatical labelling of each word inside a text with its appropriate part of speech Labelling may also contain extra information related to the morphological characteristics of the respective language like number gender person tense and aspect of the verb Many different types of taggers have been developed to improve the accuracy of the re sults in the field of literature or newspapers Nowadays when the internet is widespread the environments for online collaboration as chats forums blogs wikis have become important means of communication The purpose of the research presented in this paper is performing a comparative analysis of POS tagging in collaborative corpora specifically for chats Wikipedia and Twitter as an example of microbloggins and literature the texts from Brown corpus In this aim we implemented a trigram HMM tagger according to Jurafsky and Martin 2000 and Brants 2000 The rest of this paper is structured as follows In section 2 we briefly review the state of the art approaches to POS tagging the Markov Hidden Model the implementation of the A POS Tagger analysed in collaboration environments and literary texts trigram HMM tagger and we will analyse the factors that influence the performance of the tagger taking into account the differences between literary texts wikis microbloggings and chat copora In Section 3 we analyse the result of our work In section 4 we present the conclusions and identify the opportunities for a follow up research 2 POS tagging Over time the POS tagging has been an important topic of research and new methods have developed in order to improve the precision of the results In Jurafsky and Martin 2000 is made a classification of the methods used in resolving POS tagging in three categories stochastic methods probabilistic methods rule based methods and a combination of both hybrid taggers Usually the building of a POS tagger follows certain phases Voutilainen 2005 tokenization lexicon look up and ambiguity resolution In one study released by the Association for Computational Linguistics as regards the POS tagging problem is performed an analysis of the results of several implementations of automatically learning methods by using for training and testing the Wall Street Journal corpus Marcus et al 1993 For the TnT Tagger proposed by Brants 2000 and based on HMM a 96 46% accuracy was obtained The SVMTool Tagger introduced by Giménez and Márquez 2004 and based on Support Vector Machine obtained a 97 16% accuracy The accuracy for Stanford Tagger 2 0 Manning 2011 using the maximum entropy model was 97 32% The LTAG spinal Tagger described by Shen et al 2007 using an algorithm based on bidirectional perceptron learning has a 97 33% accuracy The Morče COMPOST Tagger presented in Spoustová et al 2009 has a 97 44% accuracy using a method based on the bidirectional perceptron learning A result with a 97 50% accuracy was obtained by the SCCN Tagger proposed by Sogaard 2011 based on a model that uses condensed nearest neighbour In terms of unknown words which are not in the training corpus the highest accuracy of 91 29% was obtained by using the MElt Tagger described by Denis and Sagot 2009 and the most unsatisfactory result of 85 86% was obtained by the TnT Tagger The previous performances analysis were performed only as we know on texts which may be considered as being in the class of literature As we mentioned in this paper we will consider also the case of texts found in collaboration environments The Internet has been a major factor in developing the informal language through com munication environments which have brought changes to the literary language The main thing that distinguishes tweets from other texts is that the Twitter message is up to 140 charac ters Chats are based on sending multiple short messages between participants and therefore a phrase may not be entirely written in one instance message There are many similarities between the microblogging texts and the chat texts One tendency is to use a lot of abbreviations and shortcuts such as "BRB" "be right back" or to drop the apostrophes or the full stops after abbreviations e g "UE" instead of "U E" The participants also omit to use capital letters at the beginning of a sentence or name and they rarely use diacritics A common custom is to use emoticons in place of words in order to express emotions and feelings Unlike the literary language one of the consequence of a rapid message is to mistype words like reversing letters missing letters joining words and so on e g "ill" instead of "I will" Frequently appear misspellings as well as the use of emphasis through character D C Cercel and Ş Trăuşan Matu repetition e g "biiigggg" instead of "big" Another particularity of the microbloggings and the chats consists in the ungrammatical inputs which are indeed more than in the literary works The chatters often tend not to respect the order of words in a sentence or the punctuation marks although the order of words and these separators have an important role in understanding the meaning Wikipedia is an editable website which allows its users to add change or overwrite its content In sharp contrast to the collective literary text this characteristic of Wikipedia of being a collaborative creation can involve grammatical alterations of the text and thus its meaning is successively modified To prevent the acts of vandalism the access to editing articles can be protected even locked so that certain persons are able to make changes 2 1 A trigram model for POS tagging An HMM according to Manning and Schutze 1999 is specified by the parameters N K A B π For the POS tagging the labels are represented as states in finite automaton HMM Thus N is the number of labels used by the model size K is the number of distinct words from the vocabulary of the model πi is the probability that the first word of the sequence is labeled with ti aij is the probability that tj label is preceded by ti label bjk is the probability that the wj word has the tj tag In a HMM the sequence of states generated by the process is not known it is hidden because is known only the sequence of observations the words in our case Given a sequence of words W = w1 w2 wn POS tagging process implies the deter mination of the most probably sequence of states that the model is going through i e the most probably sequence of T̂ labels that maximizes P T |W It results that the trigram model for POS tagging as shown in Jurafsky and Martin 2000 is T̂ = argmaxt1 tn [ n∏ i=1 P ti|ti−1 ti−2 P wi|ti ]P tn+1|tn 1 Due to insufficient data from the training corpus it may happen that a sequence of trigrams appears in the test corpus but not in the training corpus and thus we come to wrongly establish the probability of the sequence set as zero Even when the sequence of labels would appear too few times in the training corpus the probability calculated for the respective sequence would not be an exact estimation In our implementation we used a solution proposed by Thede and Harper 2011 which gives weights to the sequences of trigram bigram and unigram The probability P wi|ti is obtained by performing an analysis of the suffixes using a letter based n gram model Suffixes can provide a good indication of the associated part of speech of a word The suffixes of the words with a frequency less than or equal to the threshold frequency are used to build a data structure namely suffix tree Thus the algorithm builds a suffix tree that contains the suffixes for the words that begin with lowercase another tree for the words starting with a capital letter and also a tree for the words that start with digits Applying an approach due to Samuelsson and Reichl 1999 and Brants 2000 we calculate by interpolation the probability of a certain label where are known the last i letters from a word of L letters The most likely sequence of tags given the observed sequence of words can be solved by a brute force search evaluating the probability of each possible sequence of tags for the A POS Tagger analysed in collaboration environments and literary texts sequence of input words but it requires a large execution time In order to obtain better results we have used in our implementation the Viterbi 1967 algorithm which is based on dynaming programming 3 Evaluation For the evaluation of the tagger we used several corpora We used the Brown corpus which is one of the most known corpus for the English language described in Francis and Kucera 1979 The NPS Chat Corpus v 1 0 Forsyth and Martell 2007 was created in 2006 from various online chat rooms and contains records from a short period on a particular day and consists of 10 567 utterances WikiCorpus Reese et al 2010 represents a lexical semantic resource available for the NLP community The English portion of the corpus contains large portions of Wikipedia pages available in 2006 around 600 million words Also we used Twitter corpus labelled with parts of speech by Gimpel et al 1993 Sections train set Sections

suffixes number and the threshold frequency D C Cercel and Ş Trăuşan Matu of the words from the training set used in the building of the suffixes trees are 2 and 4 respec tively these values being experimentally determined The results for the Brown corpus have a good enough precision both for the unknown words 79 69 and for the words found in the training set 96 65% The testing of the tagger on the chat corpus had an precision of 92 95% for the known words and an precision of 60 67% for the unknown words Using the WikiCor pus the precision was over 97% for the known words and between 89 92% for the unknown words 4 Conclusions Building a POS tagger with a great accuracy for certain online collaboration environments is more difficult because there are many syntactic and semantic differences in comparison with the texts of literature or newspapers In this paper we have identified various differences that we consider the most important POS tagging results for specific online collaboration environ ments such as wikipedia chats and microblogging In a future research we will perform the analysis of the results of the POS tagger trained on old corpora and tested on a recent data set in order to identify the grammatical differences Also an interesting direction of research using a POS tagger is the analysis of the differences of grammatical labelling of the words in the text corpora between a native language and its dialects References Brants T 2000 Tnt a statistical part of sppech tagger In The 6th Applied NLP Conference Seatle WA Denis P and B Sagot 2009 Coupling

composant des autres modules du traitement du langage naturel dont les résultats doivent etre aussi précis que possible De nombreux types d‘étiqueteurs grammaticaux ont été développés pour améliorer la précision des résultats dans le domaine de la littérature ou de la presse De nos jours quand l’Internet est tres répandu les environnements de collaboration en ligne comme les clavardages les forums les blogs les wikis sont devenus des moyens importants de communication Le but de cette recherche est d’analyser les résultats obtenus dans l’étiquetage des parties du discours pour les corpora d’environnements de collaboration en ligne et le corpus de la littérature Dans le cas de ’éti quetage grammatical les ambiguités surviennent lorsqu’un mot peut avoir plusieurs valeurs morphologiques
