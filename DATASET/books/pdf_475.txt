 PLS path modeling and regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis for multi block data analysis Michel Tenenhaus HEC Paris tenenhaus hec fr hec edu Faculty and Research Faculty TENENHAUS Summary Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis RGCCA is a generalization of reg ularized canonical correlation analysis to three or more sets of variables It constitutes a general framework for many multi block data analysis methods It combines the power of multi block data analysis methods maximization of well identified criteria and the flexibility of PLS path modeling the researcher decides which blocks are connected and which are not Searching for a fixed point of the stationary equations related to RGCCA a new monotone convergent algorithm very similar to the PLS algorithm proposed by Herman Wold is obtained Finally a practical example is discussed Bibliography Michel Tenenhaus is Professor emeritus of Statistics at HEC Paris His main researches are concerned with multivariate data analysis optimal scaling methods for categorical variables PLS regression PLS path modelling and regularized generalized canonical correlation analy sis He has published many papers in scientific journals and three books Méthodes Statistiques en Gestion Dunod 1994 La régression PLS théorie et applications Technip 1998 and Statistique Méthodes pour décrire expliquer et prévoir Dunod 2007 Michel Tenenhaus is also consultant for industrial companies He has been chairman of PLS’99 at Jouy en Josas and PLS’09 in Beijing and co chairman of the following symposia PLS’01 at Anacapri PLS’03 at Lisbon and PLS’05 at Barcelona 9
