France eINSERM UMR_S 1146 LIB F 75013 Paris France fCNR IMATI Italy Abstract Mesh segmentation and annotation using semantics has received an increased interest with the recent democratisation of 3D reconstruction methods The common approach is to perform this task in two steps by first segmenting the mesh and then annotating it However this approach does not allow one part to take advantage of the other In image processing some methods are combining segmentation and annotation but they are not generic and require implementation adjustments or rewritings for each modification of the expert knowledge In this work we describe an original framework that mixes segmen tation and annotation while minimizing the required geometric analysis and we give preliminary results showing its feasability Our framework provides a generic ontology describing object feature concepts geometry topology etc and algorithms allowing to detect these concepts This ontology can be enlarged by any expert to formally describe a specific do main The formalized domain description is then used to automatically perform the joint segmentation and annotation of objects and their features by selecting at each step the most relevant algorithm given the previously detected seman tics This methodology has several advantages Firsly it allows to segment and annotate objects without any knowledge in mesh or image processing by sim ply describing the object features in terms of ontological concepts Secondly this framework can be easily reused and applied to different contexts by sim ply building on our generic ontology Finally performing the joint segmentation and annotation allows to use in an efficient way the expert knowledge reducing possible segmentation errors and the computation time by always launching the most efficient algorithm 1 Introduction During the last two decades an important work has been done in the data mining and mesh processing communities to integrate a semantic dimension to their work One of the main goal 275 A Framework for Mesh Segmentation and Annotation using Ontologies is to be able to extract an abstract description of the manipulated data using some semantic descriptors Bridging the gap between raw data and semantic concepts is a very complicated task usually implying a good knowledge about the specific applicative domain the systems are working on This link between the expert knowledge i e the semantics and the raw data can be achieved using learning techniques or by designing a deterministic system expressing the knowledge of the expert in a language of computer science Techniques for semantic extraction have been explored more precisely for mesh segmen tation where the objects and their subparts can be described very precisely using semantic terms to describe the shape the structure or the functionality A classical problem is to be able to identify an object given its shape and to recognize each of its subparts by first segmenting them then by labelling these subparts using the concepts available on the semantic domain of this object class Some of these approaches Hudelot et al 2008 Hassan et al 2010 Fouquier et al 2012 are able to question the partial semantic description of the scene and to adjust their behaviour to the context However we noticed that all these approaches contain in their implementation algorithms or procedures very specific to the applicative domain In this article we describe an original framework for mesh segmentation that push up the semantic approach creating a bridge bewteen an expert knowledge description and the segmentation algorithms This framework allows an expert in a specific domain to formally describe his own domain in terms of a fundamental ontology without any skill in geometric algorithms This formalized domain description is then used by the system to automatically recognize objects and their features within that domain The genericity of our approach is insured by a multi layer ontology modeling the expert knowledge The first layer corresponds to the basic properties of any object such as shapes and structures The next layers are specific to each application describing the functionalities and possible configurations of the objects in this domain The segmentation and identification mecanism is hidden behind the concepts of the first layer which are associated to the segmen tation algorithms We wish to highlight here that this work is exploratory and only studies the feasability of the proposed approach on a simple context After an overview of the existing methods in semantic driven expert systems and for mesh segmentation using semantics we introduce our framework for semantic driven mesh segmen tation and annotation starting with the expert knowledge modelization followed by a synthetic catalog of the segmentation algorithms and finally with the description of the proposed expert system The fourth section present some experimental results to illustrate the relevancy and feasability of our approach Finally we present possible extensions of this work and future improvements 2 Related work The design of enhanced vision systems has benefit from semantic knowledge such as ontology driven strategy The ontology paradigm in information science constitutes one of the most diffused tools to make people from various backgrounds work together Seifert et al 2011 In addition ontology based interfaces are a key component of an ergonomic Seifert et al 2011 adaptive computer system Seifert et al 2011 especially in biological clinical fields Othmani et al 2010 for which concepts and standards are constantly shifting Further more reasoning capabilities embedded in the logical framework on which ontology softwares 276 T Dietenbeck et al are built up should be a definite bridge between computer vision scientists and knowledge engineers Even though still brittle and limited reasoning inferences out of visual data may enhance the vision system experience Othmani et al 2010 as well Computer graphics is one of the different domains which benefits from the semantic knowledge through ontology strategy and for that different applications are designed to ensure the articulation between ontologies and mesh processing and to ensure a semantic representation in different domains including anatomy Hassan et al 2010 product design in e manufacturing Attene et al 2009 robotic Albrecht et al 2011 Gurau and Nüchter 2013 In Camossi et al 2007 a system to support a user in the retrieval and the semantic annotation of 3D models of objects in different application contexts is presented The ontology provides a representation of the knowledge needed to infer object’s shape functionality and behavior Then the annotation and the retrieval is performed based on the functional and behavior characteristics of the 3D model In Attene et al 2009 the ontology was used to characterize and to annotate segmented parts of a mesh using a system called “ShapeAnnotator” To this aim the ontology is loaded according the type of the input mesh and the user can link segments to relevant concepts ex pressed by the ontology While the annotation of the mesh parts is done by a simple link with the “ShapeAnnotator” Gurau and Nüchter 2013 and Shi et al 2012 proposed to feed an ontology with a set of user defined rules e g geometric properties of objects spatial relation ships and the final annotation is created according to them In Hassan et al 2010 an ontology including an approximation of the geometric shape of some anatomical organs was used to guide the mesh segmentation The parameters needed to segment the input mesh were provided by the ontology For the case of semantic classification an ontology was used also in Albrecht et al 2011 into a SLAM generated 3D point cloud map After the reconstruction of the surface planes in the point cloud the ontology is used to generate hypotheses of possible object locations and initial poses estimation and the final result is a hybrid semantic map in which all identified objects have been replaced by their corresponding CAD models Recently Feng and Pan 2013 proposed a unified framework which bridges semantics and mesh processing The mesh is divided into a fixed number of parts corresponding to the number of concepts in the ontology The parts are then annotated based on some rules defined in the ontology e g the head is very dissimilar with limbs 3 Proposed method Segmenting an object following its geometry is a non trivial problem as well as associating semantic concepts to each object and its subparts Both questions need a very specific process ing Previous works Hudelot et al 2008 Attene et al 2009 Hassan et al 2010 Fouquier et al 2012 on this topic are more and more going in the direction of mixing the two problems in order to help the segmentation using the already extracted semantics and by extracting the semantics from the partial segmentations The framework we present in this section addresses the same goal with a strong focus on the separation between segmentation algorithms and the semantic reasonings The benefits of this approach will be experimented in the next section and the possible extensions discussed in the last one but we can already underline one direct benefit of this approach using this framework to address a new applicative domain will only require the user to design the corre 277 A Framework for Mesh Segmentation and Annotation using Ontologies sponding ontology without code modification assuming that the basic concepts he will need are part of the original core of the framework The only bridge between algorithms and semantics remains here on the classification and the description of each algorithm In a first part we describe our multi layer ontology paradigm and how the expert knowledge on a specific domain is implemented on top of elementary concepts then we give the specifications of the elementary segmentation algorithms Finally we will describe the way our framework is using these two modules to address the question of semantic driven mesh segmentation 3 1 Expert knowledge description We propose in our framework to model the expert knowledge in 2 steps 1 the semantic concepts associated to the applicative domain are grouped into a multi layer ontology 2 the possible combinations of concepts of a given layer to form concepts of a higher level These combinations correspond to equivalent concepts in the ontology and will be classified at run time by the ontology reasoner Since the core of our framework needs to connect segmentation algorithms with the applicative domain ontology we designed a core ontology called S0 that contains all the elementary concepts required for a segmentation process of objects 3 1 1 Elementary semantic concepts A segmentation and semantic labelling process implies that the algorithmic part is able to identify and label regions with specific properties such as geometrical properties e g stick board cube vertical region color or texture properties e g color uniformity reflectance texture patterns but also properties linked to the position and configuration of subparts with regards to others e g parallel regions A is up wrt B A is between B and C We will refer to these properties as unary linking one region of the mesh to one concept e g geometry color texture or n ary linking several regions together through one concept e g topology distance In the expert knowledge description contained in our framework these properties are con stituting the first layer S0 of our ontology In this modelization we choose to group separately the geometrical and chromatical unary properties and the topological n ary properties More specifically an object property and a range concept is associated to each unary property in the ontology the domain being the object parts The range concept e g shape orientation color is then specialized into elementary semantic concepts e g shape → cube cylinder sphere which will correspond to the actual value of the object property Ontologies can not directly model n ary properties and we thus represent them using two object properties and a domain concept The domain concept e g position distance is also specialized into elementary semantic concepts e g distance → connected close far which are then connected to object parts through 2 object properties isReferenceRegion and isTargetRegion Fig 1a shows an unary and a n ary property while Fig 1b represents a subpart of a possi ble core ontology with domain range concepts and their corresponding elementary semantic concepts 278 T Dietenbeck et al hasShape Cube Cube isReferenceRegion isTargetRegion UpFrom a b FIG 1 a Examples

in the case of Furnitures 3 1 2 Multi layer ontology This first layer S0 blue blocks in Fig 2 is part of the core of our framework It is enriched for each applicative context with specific semantic concepts In section 3 3 we will describe the effective expert system that make the bridge between semantics and algorithms It requires that the specific semantic concepts are grouped into two or more layers one layer called S1 yellow blocks in Fig 2 using only references to concepts from the S0 layer and that describe all the object configurations that can be combinatorially drawn up i e the result of a cartesian product between elementary semantic concepts The supplementary layers S2 Sn green red and purple blocks in Fig 2 describe the combination rules to populate a complete scene 279 A Framework for Mesh Segmentation and Annotation using Ontologies 3 1 3 Linking two layers Equivalent concepts In addition to the semantic concepts of the application domain another important expert knowledge consists in how the concepts are linked with each other This can be expressed as a set of equivalent concepts of the Sn layer describing possible or impossible combinations of concepts of the Sn−1 layer The work of the expert is thus strongly simplified since he can describe not only positive rules but also negatives For example in the furniture ontology a chair leg can be described as a stick shape and a vertical orientation on the other hand the combination of a headrest without backrest is an incompatible configuration In practice incompatible configurations are specialized in specific concepts one for each incompatibility type This specialization allows to perform some reasoning and classification on partially annotated individuals Once these equivalent concepts are given by the expert they are used in two ways either to build a decision tree which will be detailled in Section 3 3 or to suggest segmentation correction Indeed during the segmentation annotation process incompatible configuration might appear due to either a segmentation error or a missing equivalent concept In this case the reasoner can be asked for the reason of the inconsistency which is then presented to the user for correction The main advantage of this approach is that it allows us to ask the user to correct errors only in the regions that caused the classification as incompatible instead of having to explore the whole mesh labelling 3 2 Semantic type signatures of algorithms In this work the core idea about the algorithmic part is to split the method into elementary algorithms that are dedicated to one of the elementary semantic concepts But this consid eration cannot be the only guide to produce a synthetic catalog of the algorithms the type signature of these algorithms cannot be only defined by a single concept Each of these algorithms will be involved in the segmentation and labellization process by splitting the given region and by adding semantic descriptors to the subparts Since a region can be described by more than one concept for example a part can be a stick and vertical and since our goal is to have the more elementary algorithms as possible we deduce that it also exist algorithms that are not splitting the given region but only increasing the knowledge on this region Finally and because we want to deal with concepts that are not necessarly involving a single region we need to distinguish functions associated to unary properties and functions associated to n ary ones The following synthetic catalog is a proposal to identify each segmentation algorithm in the context of semantic labelling semantical questions starting with find all SF with unary concepts e g find all rectangles in region A semantical questions starting with is it a SI with unary concepts e g is B a flat region topological questions T identifying n ary rela tions between regions e g are B and C connected topological questions starting with find all TF using an n ary relation and 1 to n− 1 regions to find regions satisfying the relation wrt the input regions e g find all regions connected to the region B find all regions between the regions B and C Each algorithm gets as input one or more regions of the original object and returns a set of regions each of them enriched by a semantic description generated by the function plus a score in [0 1] to illustrate the matching between this region and the associated concept This 280 T Dietenbeck et al a Overview of the proposed method applied on the furniture domain b Offline decision tree generation from the ontol ogy of the application domain FIG 3 Overview of the proposed method first synthetic catalog of possible semantic type signatures covers all the useful algorithms for mesh segmentation using semantic description as illustrated in the following sections 3 3 Expert system In this section we describe how the expert knowledge is used in our algorithm to efficiently segment and annotate an object Fig 3a gives an overview on this framework One of the advantage of our approach is that it gives the possibility to easily compute a tree containing the order of the questions to ask to reach the solution in the most efficient way To build this decision tree we first use the equivalent concepts of each layer to build the set of possible configurations For each layer and starting at the S0 layer the Cartesian product between all the properties of the layer is performed The reasoner is then used to classify the instances in equivalent concepts and incompatible candidates are removed The remaining ones are then used in the above layer as semantic concepts in the Cartesian product to compute the new list of possible configurations Once the set of all possible configurations Ω is created the idea is to split it according to the concept maximizing a criterion C The choice of this concept gives us the question to ask and thus a node of the tree For each possible answer we then get the corresponding subset and look for the next concept maximizing C This operation is iterated until only one possibility is left in each subset In the resulting tree the root thus corresponds to Ω and stores the first question to ask each leaf is a possible configuration and intermediary nodes are subsets of Ω and store the next question to ask Note that this step can be performed only once and offline in order to speed up the process This procedure is illustrated in Fig 3b The first inline step of our expert system is to browse the decision tree starting from the root the system gets the question to ask and run the associated elementary algorithm on the input object The system then selects the child node corresponding to the algorithm’s result 281 A Framework

Result of the identification orange⇒ back rest blue⇒ seat other colors⇒ feet FIG 4 Ontology and meshes used for our experiments on furniture segmentation and annota tion and the process iterates until a leaf of the tree is reached meaning that the semantics associated to the object is known as only one possible configuration remains In some cases the expert system might reach a leaf before every part of the mesh is seg mented or annotated because some concepts might be inferred from the presence absence of others Some supplementary algorithms are then run on the mesh to confirm the global seman tics and annotate the missing parts This can again be done very efficiently by questionning the reasoner which will give the expert system the missing concepts and thus the elementary algorithm to run 4 Experiments on Furnitures Segmentation and Annotation The experiments have been done on furnitures segmentation and annotation using basic shapes relevant to this domain see Fig 4b In this work we focus our interest on the expert system in order to study the feasability of the presented framework Finely selecting and adjusting elementary segmentation algorithms will be one of the future work we mention in section 5 We implemented the expert system detailed in section 3 3 using Java and the OWL API and designed our prototype such that the purely mesh manipulations are written in C++ using CGAL The connection between these two parts is done using a client server paradigm via sockets To address the specific context of furnitures we designed a dedicated ontology see Fig 4a using Protégé 1 on top of a simplified version of the elementary concepts introduced in sec tion 3 1 1 The decision tree associated to this ontology is generated following the procedure described in section 3 3 where the criterion C was chosen to be the dichotomy i e we look for concepts allowing to split the set into two subset of same size 1 protege stanford edu 282 T Dietenbeck et al a R0 b R1 c R2 d

recognize the first bench in Fig 4b The other images in Fig 4b are illustrating the segmentation and identifica tion process using the same expert ontology with various meshes We have compared our segmentation and identification method with other equivalent ap proaches and we summarize the results in Tab 1 The first column titled S then I corresponds to an approach where a first segmentation preprocessing is done to split regions then each re gion is labeled using the semantic concepts The second column titled Naive S I corresponds to an approach where the segmentation algorithms dedicated to specific kind of shapes are run independently to identify the regions The last column corresponds to our approach For each method we detailed the number of semantic find all SF and semantic is it a SI algorithms required to segment and annotate the 5 objects shown in Fig 4b We choose to distinguish the 2 kinds of algorithms because the complexity of each al gorithm family is significantly different a SF algorithm will require to browse all the given regions possibly the whole mesh and will have to extract subparts from it In comparison a SI algorithm will only have to validate or not a feature on a given region Minimizing the number of SF runs is thus the main goal of a segmentation and identification process For each region of an object the expert ontology uses 3 range concepts shape position orientation that implies 8 elementary semantic concepts Each object is also characterized by a supplementary range concept number of seats that implies 2 elementary semantic concepts per object The number of SI algorithms in the S then I has been estimated counting for each subregion of the mesh one SI per elementary semantic concept minus 1 per range concept that 283 A Framework for Mesh Segmentation and Annotation using Ontologies can be deduced plus the 1 elementary semantic concepts of the full object The Naive S I consist in running all the available SF algorithms The number of SF and SI of our method comes from the trace of the experimental runs see an example in Fig 5 We first compare our work to a S then I approach where a segmentation preprocessing is applied before the identification We cannot quantitatively compare this approach with ours but since we use the expert knowledge to reduce the number of SF algorithms in our approach we can deduce that our SF computations are almost equivalently expensive as the preprocess ing stage of the S then I approach 2 The number of SI algorithms is also strongly reduced with our approach The second considered approach for comparison is a Naive S I approach where all the SF algorithms are run The number of SF algorithms is strongly reduced by our approach and the comparison between the Naive S I approach can be summarized with a comparison between the complexity of SF and the complexity of SI algorithms These first results are illustrating the relevancy of our method with respect to the existing approaches mixing segmentation and identification steps is a good approach to reduce the complexity of the global algorithm 5 Conclusion and future work In this paper we presented a new framework for efficient segmentation and annotation of meshes It is composed of two blocks a multi layer ontology gathering the semantics on the application domain and a processing part allowing to detect elementary geometrical chromatical and topological concepts The main advantage of our method is that it separates the knowledge on the domain with the processing allowing an expert to segment and annotate an object without knowledge in image or mesh processing Another advantage is that using the expert knowledge we are able to build a decision tree to perform an efficient search amongst the set of possible objects while being able to suggest segmentation and annotation corrections to the user if an impossible configuration is reached The ontology we designed for this experiment is very basic and we plan to experiment during the next months a more complete ontology with more concepts In particular the n ary properties will be integrated in order to express more realistic constraints between subparts of the objects The simulation we presented in section 4 is using manual segmentations to mimic the result of the algorithms Our next step will be to select and adjust elementary algorithms from the litterature like geometrical extractors Mortara et al 2004 Li et al 2011 or segmentation approaches driven by functionality features Laga et al 2013 Introducing automatic segmentations will open many related questions we plan to handle in a near future One of the next challenges will be to introduce better approaches to choose between algorithms than the dichotomical one A first criterion to consider could be a weight ing system that favour algorithms with a small computational time or to include the exactness of the algorithms These weights will be introduced in the decision tree computation in order to design an expert system that handle the question of efficiency 2 The best strategy for a preprocessing can be to choose the smallest range concept then run for each elementary concept a SF algorithm 284 T Dietenbeck et al Applying our approach on meshes acquired from low resolution devices will complicate the job of the segmentation algorithms It will probably generate incoherent subregions with overlappings or unlabelled parts One possible approach is to use fuzzy maps to describe the regions but another question will have to be handled how to adjust an existing partial segmen tation Our framework is a good candidate to provide a specific answer to this problem since the expert knowledge contains information about the expected configurations One possible extension of this work could be to introduce adjustment algorithms for each elementary con cepts that will be able to adjust a first segmentation using the global knowledge of a specific domain Finally a long term extension of this work will be to introduce it into a machine learning approach where the ontology will be deduced or extended from an existing one using a set of shapes of the domain This extended framework will be a possible challenger of the 3D Shape Retrieval Contest SHREC organized each year in the mesh segmentation community

sémantique a été l’objet d’un intérêt grandissant avec la démocratisation des techniques de reconstruction 3D Une approche clas sique consiste à réaliser cette tâche en deux étapes tout d’abord en segmentant le maillage puis en l’annotant Cependant cette approche ne permet pas à chaque étape de profiter de l’autre En traitement d’images quelques méthodes combinent la segmentation et l’annotation mais ces approches ne sont pas génériques et nécessitent des ajustements d’implémentation ou des réécritures pour chaque modification des connaissances expertes Dans ce travail nous décri

décrivant uniquement les propriétés de l’objet en terme de concepts ontologiques De plus ce cadre de fontionnement peut facilement être réutilisé et appliqué à différents contextes dès lors qu’une ontologie de domaine a été définie Finalement la réalisation conjointe de la segmentation et de l’annotation permet d’utiliser d’une manière efficace la connaissance experte en réduisant les erreurs
