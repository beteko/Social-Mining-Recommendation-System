utilisateurs et leurs interac tions Récemment cette tâche a tenu compte en sus de la structure du graphe du contenu textuel généré par les utilisateurs Notre approche s’inscrit dans cette lignée des informations sont extraites du contenu textuel par des règles linguis tiques puis sont intégrées dans un système d’apprentissage automatique Nous montrerons le prototype développé et son interface de visualisation qui facilite l’interprétation des résultats 1 Introduction An influencer is a person or thing that has the power to affect people actions or events In fluencer’s detection concerns the problem of determining which users have the most influence in a certain social network Such information is crucial in many research studies such as in so ciology and information management domains Additionally with the frenetic growth of avai lable data in online social network being able to analyze and detect influential users becomes crucial as they are susceptible to express their ideas more strongly than other individuals For example this information could be used in marketing campaigns in order to maximize their spread Richardson et Domingos 2002 Formally the task for detecting influent users in a social network deals with a graph G = V E where V represents the users in the network and E the interactions among them Apart from the structural information we also assume that each user produces information as textual content Such content can induce new interactions between users through new textual content Therefore we consider the task of detecting influencers following two ways analyzing the structure of social networks as well as their textual content Our method combines rich linguistic information along with structural properties in order to feed a machine learning model for scoring users The work presented is part of the SOMA Eurostars project 1 which concerns the enhancement of customer relationship management sys tems with social media analysis capabilities 1

using graph theory where a plethora of measures exist In this context the centrality measures use the structural information in order to identify the most important nodes in a network Bonacich 1987 Indicative measures are betweenness centrality and PageRank Another line of work employs propagation models which try to specify how actions are propagated across the social network Kempe et al 2003 For example these actions could be the retweets of a post in Twitter Finally several methods try to combine content with structural information in social net works Weng et al 2010 alters PageRank in order to favor certain users according to a topic More recently Katsimpras et al 2015 proposed a supervised random walk approach towards topic sensitive influential nodes Recently Biran et al 2012 started to explore the characte ristics of communication for influence detection adopting a machine learning approach based on features such as persuasion agreement disagreement dialog patterns and sentiments This approach required the manual annotation of weblogs from LiveJournal and discussion forums from Wikipedia Cossu et al 2016 present an overview of the features that are used to cha racterize influential users in Twitter The originality of our approach is to use linguistic rules in order to extract fine grained information in the discourse between users Then this information is used as attributes in a machine learning model 3 Influence Detection Tool The concrete use case for the influence detection toolkit proceeds as follows 1 The user defines a social media source a forum a social network etc to be analyzed 2 The system collects structured e g behavioral information and unstructured data texts 3 A score of influence is attributed to each social user The developed system is composed by three main parts regarding the different aspects data consumption and preprocessing data analysis and visualization Data Wrangling Regarding the collection of data to be analyzed the tool can be plugged with any social media e g forums blogs Twitter Facebook etc with appropriate collectors and consume the data of interest Collected data concern structural e g gender location behavioral e g number of tweets and textual information Textual part of the collected data s pre processed by linguistic tools in order to extract the morphosyntactic structure Data Analysis As for identifying influencers the main challenge is the development of a hybrid system merging linguistic and non linguistic descriptors A large part of this task is usually ensured by taking into account non linguistic information that has already demons trated good results The use of linguistic information for detection influencers relies on the assumption that an influencer has a specific behavior which translates into linguistic terms This is a recent consideration from the linguistic researchers community and obtained results are encouraging Rosenthal 2015 466 I Partalas et al As for the non linguistic information we use relevant statistical information well known in the literature such as the length of messages the number of messages posted by an author the number of followers etc Regarding the linguistic information we focus on the analysis of various dimensions of the discourse intonation writing style rhetoric argumentation speech acts relation between text and context etc All the attributes extracted are used to feed a machine learning model which will allow for scoring users based on their influence To this end we use state of the art Random Forests mainly for their ability to leverage non linear interactions among features as well as for their interpretability Visualization The visualization module is Web based which allows straight forward accessi bility Specifically one can segment the social users according to key terms or topics of interest which will allow a fine grained view on the set of influencers Of course one can have global view of the detected influencers with different types of visualization Figure 1 presents a screen of the visualization module where the top 20 users are presented in form of bubbles according to their score of influence Figure 2 presents the interaction among users in a graph for a certain discussion Users with higher score of influence are represented with bigger circles FIG 1 – Visualization of users

representing the users and their interactions Recent approached take into account in addition to the struc ture of the graph the textual content generated by the users Along this line our approach uses information extracted from the textual content by linguistic rules and then integrated into a machine learning system In this work we present the developed prototype along with the visualization used in order to facilitate the interpretation of the results 468
