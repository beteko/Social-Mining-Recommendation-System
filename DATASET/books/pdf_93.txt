60 RNTI E33Enhanced user user collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on semantic ratings Wen Zhang Raja Chiky Manuel Pozo Stanford University zhangwen cs stanford edu ISEP Paris LISITE Lab firstname lastname isep fr 1 Introduction This paper presents a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm that borrows ideas from content based models by taking into account both the ratings and user preferences for item attributes This is achieved by replacing each rating with its corresponding "semantic rating" which combines the original score and the user’s historical preference level for the item’s attributes Pozo et al 2016 This algorithm can achieve better results than a pure collaborative filtering counterpart oblivious to the intrinsic properties of each individual item We base our work on a previous experience Pozo et al 2016 which proposes the "seman tic equation" as a transformation from an original rating to its corresponding semantic rating thereby capturing a user’s preference for an item’s attributes Since it is only a transformation of ratings this technique can be used in different kinds of collaborative filtering algorithms Pozo et al 2016 applied the semantic equation on top of a matrix factorization algorithm and found that the semantic approaches yielded better results in terms of precision recall and intra list diversity In this paper we apply the same idea to a simple neighborhood method based on Pearson correlations We validate Pozo et al 2016 and deeper shows the effect of these "semantic transfomation" by analyzing the "semantic amendments" only 2 Semantic algorithms The semantic algorithms that we propose are all based on the semantic equation which turns a rating ru i into its amended semantic rating ru i Pozo et al 2016 For a user u and an item i we define their "semantic amendment" which captures the user’s historical preference for the item’s attributes as follows ∆u i = r̄u · ∣ ∣ ∣ ∑ a∈A i Cu aWt a ∣ ∣ ∣ |S u | 1 where Cu a = |{i ∈ S u a ∈ A i }| denotes the number of times attribute a appears in all items rated by user u and Wt a denotes the “weight” of the attribute a’s type Note that ∆u i 443 Enhanced user user collaborative filtering should be computed entirely from the training set although it is not required that user u have rated item i The weight Wt of an attribute type t reflects its relevancy and is constant throughout the computation an attribute type that is more relevant in making predictions should be assigned a higher weight Note that the weights belong to attribute types instead of individual attributes The weights are best chosen according to each attribute type’s degree of relevancy obtained from PCA Pozo et al 2016 The semantic equation can then be expressed as ru i = ru i +∆u i 2 where ru i can either be a rating originally present in the dataset or be one predicted by an algorithm Consequently there is more than one place where we can apply Equation 2 in the training testing process 1 The input approach semantic algorithm results from applying Equation 2 to the cal culation of Pearson correlations in the training stage 2 The output approach semantic algorithm results from applying Equation 2 to the pre diction results in the prediction stage we transform each predicted rating pu i into its semantic rating pu i = pu i +∆u i which we use as the final prediction result 3 CONCLUSION We perform evaluations on the MovieLens GroupLens dataset Can 2011 which consists of 2 113 users 10 197 movies and 855 598 ratings It also contains six attributes genres directors actors countries locations and tags with 112 881 distinct attribute values We measure the precision recall and f measure for a baseline algorithm non semantic pearson algorithm and the semantic algorithm Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of using semantic ratings with a user user collaborating filtering algorithm based on Pearson correla tions When information on items’ attributes is present making use of this information can often lead to better prediction performance by some metrics even if we do not resort to a full hybrid algorithm The most evident strength of the semantic transformation is that it enables algorithms to suggest more items that are provably relevant the more semantically influenced an algorithm is the higher precision and recall it yields This finding is most directly supported by the fact that the pure output approach semantic algorithm which simply uses the semantic amend ments as its predictions gives substantially higher precision recall and f measure References 2011 HetRec ’11 Proceedings of the 2Nd International Workshop on Information Hetero geneity and Fusion in Recommender Systems New York NY USA ACM Pozo M R Chiky and E Métais 2016 Enhancing Collaborative Filtering Using Implicit Relations in Data pp 125–146 Berlin Heidelberg Springer Berlin Heidelberg 444
