Personalization paradigm aims at providing users with the most rel evant content and services according to many factors such as interest center or location at the querying time All this knowledge and requirements are orga nized into user profiles and contexts A user profile encompasses metadata de scribing the user whereas a context groups information about the environment of interaction between the user and the system An interesting problem is there fore to identify which part of the profile is significant in a given context This paper proposes a contextualization service which allows defining relationships between user preferences and contexts Further we propose an approach for the automatic discovery of these mappings by analyzing user behavior extracted from log files 1 Introduction Personalization paradigm aims at adapting applications as much as possible to the user preferences and to the user context Adaptation may concern several aspects such as system reconfiguration communication protocols data sources selection query reformulation data layout or users feedback handling Data personalization refers to the set of techniques which allow providing users with the most relevant content There exist two approaches for adapting and customizing application interactions User Centric Personalization and Context Aware Application Considering only one of the previous approches may not be satisfactory for many applica tions Indeed the same user with different profiles may prefer listening news during breakfast and listening Rn’B music while driving a car Alternatively the same user at his home con text may have different domains of interest related to his hobbies or to his job Thus allowing applications to combine both approaches leverages their adaptability to the benefit of the users The goal of this paper is to show through the definition of a specific service called contex tualization how a Personalized Access Model PAM can operate on both profile and context Given a profile model and a context model Contextualization is defined as a cross filtering process run periodically over the user’s interaction log file to extract possible associations A contextualization service between profile and context instances called contextual preferences The contextualization service is part of a set of services composing the PAM and aiming to provide high level mech anisms to build personalized applications This paper is organized as follows Section 2 gives an overview of the PAM architecture and services Section 3 defines the contextualization service Section 4 reports on related works Section 5 concludes the paper with current results and further research 2 PAM The Personalized Access Model Our definition of a personalized access model aims to provide a generic set of concepts and techniques which can be deployed over a given architecture to make applications adaptable to users’ profiles and contexts The figure 1 gives an overview of the main components of a PAM FIG 1 – Personalized Access Model Architecture The persistency layer deals with the storage and the access to the profiles and to the con texts It includes the profile and the context catalogs The functional layer is composed of services for profile and context management and personalized access services Finally the communication layer provides a communication interface between the PAM and users or ap plications The role of this layer is on one hand to give access to the profiles and the contexts database and on the other hand to enable calling the PAM services The components of the three layers of the PAM are built around profile and context meta models which are generic enough to be adapted to a wide range of applications and which are open to integrate specific knowledge not included initially More details on the PAM can be found in Abbar et al 2008 3 The Contextualization Service The contextualization service aims at identifying relationships between user preferences and contexts To achieve this task the process we propose takes as input the user behavior captured in log files This process is divided into three steps result partitioning mapping initialization and context specificity check see figure 2 S ABBAR et al FIG 2 – Global profile contextualization process 3 1 Notation and Problem definition A user profile is a set of preferences Pu = {p1 pn} Each preference pi is composed of a predicate pri and a weight wi i e pi = pri wi The weight wi is a real number expressing the importance of the predicate pri for the user The predicate characterizes a given concept It is a triplet <concept operator value> e g Genre = ’Drama’ A context cj is defined as a set of pairs attribute value e g location = ’Paris’ We consider that a context is represented by its identifier cj The set C is the set of contexts which are of some interest for the application i e C = {c1 cm} For a given user whose profile is Pu the profile contextualization consists in specifying a setM of mappings which relates the user preferences with the contexts of C M Pu C = {m pi cj δ | pi ∈ Pu cj ∈ C δ ∈ [−1 1]} where δ is the mapping score of pi with respect to the context cj According to the value of δ there are three interpretations of the mapping m pi cj δ a positive mapping δ > 0 indicates that the predicate pri has to be satisfied in the context cj a negative mapping δ < 0 points out that the predicates pri would not be satisfied in the context cj and a neutral mapping δ = 0 specifies that the predicate pri is irrelevant in the context cj Mappings are discovered by analyzing the user historyH captured in log files The profile contextualization process takes as input a non contextualized user profile Pu the user history H and the set C of contexts handled by a given application It returns the set of mappings M Pu C The remaining of this section details each steps of the process as presented in figure 2 3 2 Result Partitioning This first step consists in identifying which content the user liked and which he disliked This phase produces two sets containing respectively relevant contents and irrelevant contents for each context In the following POS Pu cj and NEG Pu cj denote respectively the set of relevant and irrelevant contents in the context cj for a user profile Pu The identification of relevant and irrelevant contents in the log is done by analyzing actions that the user performed on those contents Further relevance of contents in the POS and NEG sets may differ with regard to the type of the action applied to them In POS set for example A contextualization service a bought product is more important for a given user than visualized one even if user spent a lot of time on it Thus we propose to organize all possible actions in a relational table which describes actions with their eventual weights Actions with positive weights are said positive actions and contents on which they are performed are considered as being relevant to the user whereas actions with negative weights are said negative actions and contents on which they are applied are considered as being irrelevant 3 3 Mappings initialization The second step consists in initializing the possible mappings between the user profile predicates and contexts This is done by computing the occurrence frequencies δ+ij and δ − ij of each profile predicate in POS Pu cj and NEG Pu cj respectively The value of δij depends on whether the frequency δ+ij respectively δ − ij satisfies a given condition γ + δ+ij respectively γ− δ−ij as for instance a threshold If only γ+ δ+ij holds i e a sufficient part of the relevant results satisfies the predicate a positive mapping m pi cj δ + ij is created Similarly if only γ − δ−ij holds a negative mapping m pi cj δ − ij is created If both γ + δ+ij and γ − δ−ij are not satisfied a neutral mapping m pi cj 0 is created Finally if both γ + δ+ij and γ − δ−ij hold the predicate corresponds to a user preference which is always valid Thus a positive mapping m pi cj δij is created with δij equal to the average of pi frequencies in the set union of relevant and irrelevant results δij = freq pi POS Pu ci ∪NEG Pu ci 3 4 Context specificity check This step prunes mappings which relate the same profile predicate to all contexts These mappings correspond to the last case discussed in section 3 3 and concern profile predicates which have not to be contextualized as they have to be considered in all contexts For example if the user watches only movies in English then all relevant results will satisfy the predicate “language="English"” but the same will be true for all irrelevant results too This kind of pred icates has to be taken into account in all contexts as it corresponds to a general user preferences The result of this step is a set of valid mappings between the user profile and contexts 3 5 Mapping construction algorithm Discovering automatically contextual preferences is a complex task Therefore we made a simplifying hypothesis for the design of the algorithm All user actions express positive preferences and are of the same importance As explained before the algorithm takes as input a user profile Pu logs of userH a set of contexts C and a threshold γ for mapping validation The main step of the algorithm is to compute the frequency in the log of each user predicate for each context Then following the value of those frequencies mappings will be created If the predicate has a occurence frequency that satisfies γ in all contexts then a positive mapping m pi C AV G F is created attesting that predicate pri holds in all contexts of the set C with AV G F the average of all frequencies of apparition This predicate is always satisfied independently of the context thus it can be seen as a user view characteristic S ABBAR et al Algorithm 1 Automatic mapping discovery Require the user profile Pu = {p1 pn} the user behaviorH the set of possible contexts C = {c1 cm} the threshold γ Ensure the set of contextualization mappingsM 1 M← ∅ 2 for all pi ∈ Pu do 3 Compute F = f1 fM such as fk = Freq pri cj H {where Freq pricj H is the frequency of the predicate pri inH when the context is cj } 4 if ∃i j | fi ≥ γ ∧ fj < γ then 5 for all fk ∈ F do 6 if fk ≥ γ then 7 M←M∪m pi ck fk {the predicate holds in the context} 8 else 9 M←M∪m pi ck 0 {the predicate does not hold in the context} 10 else 11 if ∀fk ∈ F fk < γ then 12 M←M∪m pi C 0 {predicate which does not hold in any context} 13 else 14 M←M∪m pi C AV G F {predicate that holds in all contexts user view } 15 return M If any occurence frequency of a given predicate satisfies γ then a neutral mapping m pi C 0 is created attesting that the predicate pri is not contextual In other words the predicate is not relevant for contexts of the set C That is the case of rarely occasionally used predicates If the predicate is frequent in some contexts only the predicate is contextual Indeed it is relevant to take it into account in some contexts then mappings m pi ck fk are created for each of these context with the correspondent frequency and to ignore it in the others where neutral mapping m pi ck 0 are created for each of the remainder contexts 4 Related Works Recently contextualization of user profile and preferences has attracted attention In Hol land and Kiessling 2004 authors propose a framework for contextual preferences called situated preferences In this approach both user profiles and situations are modelled in an Entity relationship model then contextualization of preferences is modelled uniquely as M N relationship pid sid expressing that the preference pid holds in the situation sid No detail are given about relationship construction In their research Stefanidis and Pitoura 2008 in troduced context into the database field The context which is a set of contextual attribute e g Age weather is used to rank database tuples w r t a given query Contextual preferences are explicitly specified by users and are of the form <contextState preferencePredicate Score> The difference with our proposition is that authors consider a user profile as being a part of the context while we clearly separated these two concepts this may be due to the different point of view we consider An automatic discovery of contextual preferences was initiated by Agrawal et al 2006 In Bunningen et al 2007 contextual preferences are also automat A contextualization service ically generated by observing and analyzing user histories Preference are modeled throught description logical frame and the discover of contextual preferences is done automatically by calculating the probability that an element be the best one in a particular context 5 Conclusion In this paper we have presented a personalization service called contextualization which allows finding dependencies between user profiles and contexts by exploiting user application interaction logs The service can be used at design time or periodically as a maintenance service which keeps up to date the semantic links between profiles and contexts for a given application The contextualization service is a service among several others which constitute a coherent personalized access model PAM Further research will focus on the binding service which exploit at execution time the mappings generated by the contextualization service to make user queries sensitive to user profile to interaction context or to both of them References Abbar S M Bouzeghoub D
