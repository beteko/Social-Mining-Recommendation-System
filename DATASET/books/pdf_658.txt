Sud Ouest 351 cours de la Libération 33405 Talence cedex FRANCE {faraz zaidi guy melancon} labri fr Abstract The exponential growth of data in various fields such as Social Net works and Internet has stimulated lots of activity in the field of network analysis and data mining Identifying Communities remains a fundamental technique to explore and organize these networks Few metrics are widely used to discover the presence of communities in a network We argue that these metrics do not truly reflect the presence of communities by presenting counter examples This is because these metrics concentrate on local cohesiveness among nodes where the goal is to judge whether two nodes belong to the same community or vise versa Thus loosing the overall perspective of the presence of communities in the entire network In this paper we propose a new metric to identify the presence of communities in real world networks This metric is based on the topological decomposition of networks taking into account two important ingredients of real world networks the degree distribution and the density of nodes We show the effectiveness of the proposed metric by testing it on various real world data sets 1 Introduction Most real world systems take the form of networks where a set of nodes and edges might be used to represent these networks Examples include social networks metabolic networks world wide web food web transport networks Community detection remains an important technique to organize and understand these complex networks Girvan and Newman 2002 Roughly speaking we like to define a community as a decomposition of a set of entities into ‘Natural Groups’ Detection of communities has a wide range of applications in various fields For example in social networks community detection could lead us towards a better under standing of how people collaborate with each other or in a transport network a community might represent cities or countries well connected through transportation means Broadly speaking research in the field of network analysis can be divided into two cate gories First by developing some metrics that can help us to analyze and detect community structures and second developing algorithmic procedures to find and group the communities present in the networks In this paper we focus on different metrics proposed for community RNTI E 19 163 Identifying the Presence of Communities Through Decomposition and Densities FIG 1 – Two networks with the same number of nodes and edges a Encircled nodes represent four perfect community structures disconnected to each other and densely connected within and b represents one single connected component with nodes sharing neighbors detection The motivation of this work comes from a simple yet important question Is there a metric that can assure me the presence of communities in a network To answer this question we need a formal definition of a community Until now we avoided using the term clustering which is probably a more generic formalism of the term community This is because of a metric called clustering coefficient which might be misleading we will discuss this metric further in Sec 2 Sociologists use the term community Coleman 1964 as compared to the statistical and data mining domain where people use the term clusters Tryon 1939 to refer to the same concept Thus a community or a cluster can be defined as a group of elements having the following properties as described by Wasserman and Faust 1994 • Mutuality Group members choose each other to be included in the group In a graph theoretical sense this means that they are adjacent • Compactness Group members are well reachable for each other though not necessarily adjacent Graph theoretically elements of the same cluster have short distances • Density Group members have many contacts to each other In terms of graph theory that is group members have a large neighborhood inside the group • Separation Group members have more contacts inside the group than outside Based on these concepts a perfect community structure in a network would be represented by disconnected cliques as shown in Fig 1 a The connected components in Fig 1 a satisfy all the properties described above as being a perfect community structure Notice that the two graphs has exactly the same number of nodes and edges To the best of our knowledge there is no such metric which tries to identify the presence of communities in a network by analyzing the graph on the whole in a global perspective There are metrics like Clustering Coefficient and Jaccard Index see section 2 for more details that determine local cohesiveness of a set of nodes i e they focus on the immediate neighborhood of nodes but they fail to capture the pres ence of communities on the whole as argued by different researchers Brandes and Erlebach 2005 Girvan and Newman 2002 Fig 1 b is an example that depicts this phenomena where several nodes share common neighbors but it is difficult to identify communities in such a network In this paper we aim to develop a metric which helps us to identify these dense components as shown in Fig 1 a We use two important ingredients of real world networks the node RNTI E 19 164 Zaidi et Melançon degree to decompose the network into several subgraphs and density of nodes to identify the presence of a community Being able to identify communities in a network has several real world applications such as grouping similar entities into groups can help us understand and model the behavior of real world systems Once we identify the presence of communities in a network eventually an algorithm can be built to group these communities But in this paper we limit ourselves to proposing only a metric where a detailed study of a possible clustering procedure and comparing its results with other clustering algorithms remains out of scope A huge advantage of the proposed metric is that it can be calculated in almost linear time making it applicable on large size data sets as compared to different indices that have very high run time complexity Moreover the topological decomposition implicitly embeds the knowl edge of node degrees which helps us to identify the presence of communities with respect to the degree of nodes We briefly describe different metrics present in the literature related to the community de tection problem in section 2 Section 3 presents the different data sets used for experimentation In section 4 we present the mathematical details of the proposed metric Section 5 is devoted to analyzing different data sets with respect to the proposed metric followed by interesting ob servations derived from the proposed metric in section 6 Finally we present conclusions and future research directions 2 Related Work Different metrics exist in the literature to study the community detection problem Broadly classifying these metrics we can say that some metrics are local i e calculated upon either nodes or edges as compared to metrics that are calculated over the entire graph An example of a local metric would be the in out degree of a node Our goal is to find a metric that is calculated for the entire graph and does not focus on individual nodes and edges On the other hand examples of popular global metrics include Betweenness Centrality and Node Eccentricity Brandes and Erlebach 2005 To the best of our knowledge none of the global metrics are designed to identify the presence of community structures Below we review a few metrics that address the community detection problem locally One of the most widely used metric in network analysis is the clustering coefficient pro posed by Watts and Strogatz 1998 This metric can be often misleading due to its name as this metric does not guarantee the presence of communities in a network For example consider the two networks shown in Fig 1 Calculating the average clustering coefficient of network a gives us a value of 0 88 and that of network b a value of 0 61 Both these values do not re flect the underlying structure of the network where Fig 1 a has intuitively distinct community structure as compared to Fig 1 b This metric along with the average path length were used by Watts and Strogatz 1998 to classify networks as being small world networks having ‘six degree of separation’ principle Milgram 1967 Another popular metric is the Jaccard Index introduced by Jaccard 1901 also known as Jaccard similarity coefficient This metric is used to measure the similarity of two elements based on common neighborhood More precisely the index looks at the number of common neighbors of the two elements and compares it with the size of all the neighbors of the two elements An edge is assigned high similarity value if they share lots of neighbors Coming back to our example in Fig 1 a if we consider the edges connecting the clique with three RNTI E 19 165 Identifying the Presence of Communities Through Decomposition and Densities nodes only all its edges are assigned a value 0 33 as compared to the edges of the clique with five nodes that are assigned a value 0 6 A low edge value might suggest that the an edge is not part of a community which in this case is contradictory to the definition of a community structure we presented earlier as the edge with 0 33 value is in fact part of a community Several Other metrics have been proposed in the literature where Melançon and Sallaberry 2008 provide a good comparative study of various local metrics for the community detection problem The jaccard index clearly stands out as the archetype metric for finding communities in networks based on the notion of a triad Readers are recommended Melançon and Sallaberry 2008 for further details We would like to refer to another metric which is not used for community detection rather to classify networks and has gained a lot of popularity in the domain of network analysis The metric degree distribution classifies networks as being scale free if the degree distribution follows a power law In other words this means that there are a few nodes that have a very high number of connections and lots of nodes have only a few connections These networks have many interesting properties Barabasi and Albert 1999 and we use this knowledge to get inspiration for our metric where details are described in section 4 3 Data Sets We use several real world data sets for experimentation Co authorship Network contains the collaboration network of scientists posting preprints on the condensed matter archive at arxiv org between 1995 1999 as compiled by Newman 2001 The network contains 1670 nodes and 47600 edges Movie Database is an actor actor graph where two actors are connected to each other if they have acted in a movie together It contains a reachable graph of distance 5 starting from the actress Sharon Stone from movies made until the year 1999 see Archambault et al 2007 for more details This network contains 7640 nodes and 27600 edges approx Air Transport Network is an airport airport graph where edges represent a direct flight from one airport to the other This network has attracted lots of researchers from the field of geography and transportation see Rozenblat et al 2008 for details This network contains 1540 nodes and 16500 edges Internet Tomography Network is a collection of routing paths from a test host to other networks on the Internet The database contains routing and reachability information and is available to the public from the Opte Project website opte org This network contains 35800 nodes and 42400 edges American Football contains the network of American football games between Division IA colleges during regular season Fall 2000 as compiled by Girvan and Newman 2002 Teams are represented by nodes and edges represent a game between two teams This network contains 115 nodes and 616 edges To further assert the efficiency of our metric for each of these real world networks we generate artificial networks of equal sizes using two known graph models the random networks Erdos and Renyi 1960 and the small world network Watts and Strogatz 1998 We expect to find community structures in small world networks where as an absence of communities from the random networks RNTI E 19 166 Zaidi et Melançon FIG 2 – A partial view of Max12−DIS of Co authorship network where disconnected compo nents can be easily identified for high density 4 Topological Decomposition for Edge Distribution As discussed previously in this paper we present a new metric to identify the presence of communities The goal is obviously to find densely connected nodes that can be identified as communities Our inspiration comes from the fact that in real world networks the degree dis tribution is not random rather it follows a pattern where different nodes have varying degrees Barabasi and Albert 1999 In the presence of nodes having high degree it is difficult to identify dense components in a network Zaidi et al 2009 Thus as a first step we introduce a decomposition based on the topology of the network As a result the network breaks into several components disconnected from each other as shown in Fig 2 We can then calculate the densities of each connected component to identify the presence of dense components in the entire network Thus we propose a three step approach topological decomposition connected component identification and calculating component densities All these steps can be performed in linear time in terms of number of edges in the worst case considering that the maximum degree in a graph is bounded by a low constant factor Topological Decomposition We introduce the idea of Maxd Degree Induced Subgraph Maxd DIS where Maxd DIS is an induced subgraph constructed by considering only the nodes hav ing degree at most d in G Mathematically for a graph G V E where V is a set of nodes and E is a set of edges the Maxd DIS is defined as G′ V ′ E′ such that V ′ ∈ V and E′ ∈ E and ∀u ∈ V ′ DegG u ≤ d where d can have values from 0 to the maximum node degree possible for a network Similarly we can construct Mind DIS where DegG u ≥ d Through out the paper we use the term DIS to refer to both max and min degree induced subgraphs Lets consider an example from the Co authorship network by drawing a Max12−DIS Note that a node having degree 12 in the original graph might not have the same degree in the induced subgraph Moreover it is also evident that these nodes might no longer be connected to each other as shown in Fig 2 By construction when we consider a Max DIS we essentially include nodes of up to degree d only This helps us to understand how the edges are distributed among nodes having degree d − 1 From the Fig 2 it is evident the Max12−DIS helps us to identify dense components of up to degree d− 1 in the entire network Consider part of a graph where a clique of 6 nodes exists RNTI E 19 167 Identifying the Presence of Communities Through Decomposition and Densities FIG 3 – Example of Max5−DIS before and after calculating Max5−DIS as shown in Fig 3 The clique is connected to the entire network through a single node All the nodes in this clique have degree 5 except the node which connects this clique to the entire network which in this case has degree 6 When we build the Max5−DIS the node with degree 6 will not be included in the induced subgraph and only the enclosed nodes having degree 5 will be part of the Max5−DIS Thus in this way we can identify densely connected nodes in the entire network We argue that iterating over the Maxd DIS from small values of d to the maximum possible degree in the original network we can identify the presence of densely connected components if there are any Creating induced subgraph for all possible values of node degrees is bounded by the maximum degree possible in the entire network Since we are going to calculate the metric for both Maxd DIS and Mind DIS the time complexity of creating the induced sub graph is O 2 maxd m where maxd is the maximum node degree and m is the total number of edges in G Calculation of Connected Components The next step is to calculate all the connected components in the subgraph We use a breadth first search algorithm BFS starting from a node and iterating through its neighbors to find the connected component it belongs to Once we have identified nodes connected to the start node we restart the BFS from a node that has not yet been visited All the connected components of a graph can thus be calculated in O n + m time where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges in G Measuring Component Densities of Graphs Now that we have decomposed the graph and identified connected components we calculate a metric to quantify the presence of densely connected components if there are any We use a metric proposed by Watts and Strogatz 1998 called local clustering coefficients but since we apply it to individual connected components as opposed to the whole graph we prefer to call it component densities We assign a component density to each individual connected component using the following equation CDk = ek 2 nk nk − 1 1 Where CDk represents the Component Density CD of connected component k ek rep resents the number of edges in k and nk represents the number of nodes in k The equation represents the ratio of the number of edges in component k to the maximum number of edges possible in the component A value of 1 suggests that the component is a clique and since the component is connected the minimum CD value possible is 2 nk Note that checking whether a connected component is a clique is no more than a counting problem where we can identify RNTI E 19 168 Zaidi et Melançon the presence of a clique by simply counting the number of nodes and the number of edges in a connected component We would like to mention that we do not address the well known maximal clique problem using this metric which is known to be NP Complete Cook 1971 Moreover we do not try to find cliques of a fixed size k which is shown to be solvable in O nk by Nesetril and Poljak 1985 as our the method does not gurantee that we will find cliques of some fixed size k The proposed method is capable of finding cliques in linear times in terms of number of edges irrespective of the size of the clique Once we have calculated the CD for individual connected components in the DIS we calculate the weighted component density for all the connected components in a DIS We represent this value by CDGd for d degree induced subgraph and is calculated by the equation CDGd = kmax∑ k=0 nk CDk nd 2 Where CDGd represents the weighted Component Density of d DIS While calculating the CDGd we exclude the weight of components having only 1 or 2 nodes as it biases the CDGd We do count them in the total number of nodes nd present in the induced subgraph though This is because if a graph has lots of 0 degree nodes its overall component density will be lower than a graph with well connected higher degree nodes The weight is associated to ensure that components having more nodes are weighted more as compared to components having fewer nodes The CDGd can be calculated for different values of d where the d can take values from 0 to the maximum degree of a node in G The calculations in Eq 1 and 2 are totally independent of how the subgraph was constructed and thus can be used to calculate the component densities of either Maxd DIS or Mind DIS The CDG values of Maxd DIS given by CDGMaxd and Mind DIS given by CDGMind represents the presence or absence of dense components in G High values of CDG suggest that there are densely connected components in the induced subgraph which eventually represent communities in G Another supplementary information that can be extracted from CDG values is that by identifying the peak value of CDGMaxd and CDGMind we can point the out the induced subgraphs in which these communities are present as shown in Fig 2 We plot graphs for the respective CDGMaxd and CDGMind values for the data sets de scribed in section 3 as shown in Fig 6 The values on the x axis represent the maximum degree of each network which in turn represents the number of subgraphs generated for each net work The values on the y axis are the CDG values which can be between 0 and 1 where 1 represents the presence of perfect community structure with cliques For each real world data set we have also generated small world and random networks of equivalent number of nodes and edges so that we can compare the behavior of the metric with the corresponding artificially generated network These networks are drawn using Dotted Line for Small world networks and Dashed Line for Random networks 5 Analyzing Different Data Sets using Components Densi ties of Graph The evaluation of CDGMaxd and CDGMind for Random networks and Small world net works for graphs of different sizes can be generalized easily For random networks we do not RNTI E 19 169 Identifying the Presence of Communities Through Decomposition and Densities expect to find any community structure and thus these networks have low CDG values for all the test cases as shown in Fig 6 On the other hand we have the small world networks which by definition contain communities and this is well reflected by the high CDG values for all the artificially generated networks One exception is the case where the generated small world graph is equivalent to the size of the Internet network This is due to the low overall density of the Internet graph itself as the edges scale linearly with the number of nodes We first look at the Co authorship and the Movie networks Both these graphs have similar CDGMaxd and CDGMind values as shown in Fig 6 a b c d This is due to the fact that both these networks follow the small world and scale free structure where there are many low degree nodes and a few nodes dominated most number of connections representing the scale freeness of the graphs This phenomena can be deduced from Fig 4 a where we show the plot for the degree distribution of the Movie network Moreover the high CDGMaxd values suggest that there are communities present in the low degree nodes as well as in the high CDGMind values representing the small world architecture of the two networks FIG 4 – Degree distribution for the Movie Air Transport and the Internet network In case of the co authorship network Fig 6 a and b the peak values of 0 4 for CDGMaxd are attained when the degree values are between 6 and 8 This suggests that most of the dense communities are present when node degrees have a maximum value of 8 This result has log ical semantics to it as we are considering a collaboration network of researchers and they are connected to each other if they publish an article Mostly 6 to 8 people appear as authors in an article forming cliques in the collaboration network This information is well represented by the CDGMaxd values On the other hand the CDGMind represents the collaboration of authors who publish a lot Since the data set comes from a particular domain of research it is not a sur prise to see that the people having the highest degrees collaborate with each other The Movie Database follows a similar structure to that of the Co authorship network The peak value for CDGMax16 is 0 87 Drawing the Max16−DIS we can clearly see different actors are densely connected to each other as shown in Fig 5 a The Air transport network is an interesting example Fig 6 e and f It has a scale free structure as can be seen from the degree distribution of the network in Fig 4 b This network is not classified as a small world network as it does not have a high clustering co efficient Rozenblat et al 2008 Using our metric we are still able to find densely connected nodes as we get high values for Mind−DIS The community structure found is shown in Fig 5 b where all the worlds busiest airports are connected to each other through a direct flight This makes RNTI E 19 170 Zaidi et Melançon FIG 5 – a Max16−DIS for the Movie database representing lots of densely connected com ponents b Min158−DIS for the Air Transport network where all the major cities in the world are well connected to each other sense as the worlds most important airports like New York Paris London all have a direct flights to each other The Internet network is not classified as a small world as it is has low clustering co efficient Using our metric we do not find any community structure neither in the CDGMaxd nor in the CDGMind graphs thus reflecting the correctness of the metric The degree distribu tion of the internet graph is shown in Fig 4 c Finally the Football network where we suspected an absence of communities within this network as teams might like to uniformly distribute the number of games amongst their oppo nents which turned out to be a false assumption It is quite clear from the high CDGMaxd and CDGMind that there are communities present in this network This is because certain teams play more frequently within the same region or by playing with the teams that have a his tory behind them An important remark using the CDGMind values is that the highest degree nodes do not form a community structures which suggests that teams playing more games not necessarily play against each other 6 Inferences and Observations Apart from identifying the presence of communities in different networks interesting prop erties of real world networks can be observed using the CDGMaxd and CDGMind graphs We list these below • Networks are usually classified as either Random Small World Scale Free or both Small World Scale free at the same time Using the proposed metric we can have further in sight in these networks by understanding how the edges are distributed in low or high degree nodes of these networks Communities can exist in nodes that have a low degree in the graph as is the case with Co authorship and Movie networks or they can exist RNTI E 19 171 Identifying the Presence of Communities Through Decomposition and Densities only in high degree nodes Air Transport network or in nodes having an average degree Football network • The absence of communities can have two consequences either the network is Random or it follows a scale free behavior In case of scale free behavior networks usually consist of star like structures where many nodes connect to a single node Typical example is the routing information of servers in case of the Internet network From the proposed metric we are able to find the same behavior in the Air transport network where the degree of nodes is not very high Logically speaking an airport in a capital city of a small country will play the role of a hub where the smaller cities will have a direct flight to the capital city which will eventually be connected to one of the major airports of the world • Another interesting observation about the Internet network is the absence of community structure in the high degree nodes This means that if two high degree nodes are to communicate with each other they pass through a low degree node Although this preliminary analysis reveals some interesting facts about the different data sets a more detailed study by the domain experts might reveal more information We believe that this analysis and any other information can help researchers find better ways to group entities together Moreover since the analysis is highly efficient in terms of time complexity it is quite practical for future research where the size of data is growing exponentially 7 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have introduced a metric based on the topological decomposition of graphs We call this metric component density of graphs The metric helps us to identify the presence of community structure in real world complex networks Calculation of this metric takes linear time in terms of number of edges and proves to be very fast when applied to large size data sets We have tested the metric with different data sets and show the effectiveness of the metric by comparing the results with small world and random network models More over the topological decomposition proposed opens new dimensions in the field of visual data mining as complex networks can be simplified using the proposed method As part of future work we believe that this metric can lay a foundation for building a high speed clustering al gorithm for large size networks Since this metric is quite efficient discovering clusters using this metric will remain highly efficient in terms of time complexity References Archambault D T Munzner and D Auber 2007 Grouse
