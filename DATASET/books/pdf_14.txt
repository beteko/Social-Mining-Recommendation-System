 Community structure in complex networks Santo Fortunato Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research CNetS School of Informatics and Computing Indiana University santo fortunato aalto fi Summary Complex systems typically display a modular structure as modules are easier to assemble than the individual units of the system and more resilient to failures In the network repre sentation of complex systems modules or communities appear as subgraphs whose nodes have an appreciably larger probability to get connected to each other than to other nodes of the network In this talk I will address three fundamental questions How is community structure generated How to detect it How to test the performance of community detection algorithms I will show that communities emerge naturally in growing network models favoring triadic clo sure a mechanism necessary to implement for the generation of large classes of systems like e g social networks I will discuss the limits of the most popular class of clustering algorithms those based on the optimization of a global quality function like modularity maximization Testing algorithms is probably the single most important issue of network community detec tion as it implicitly involves the concept of community which is still controversial I will discuss the importance of using realistic benchmark graphs with built in community structure Biography Santo Fortunato is the Director of the Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research CNetS at Indiana University and a Scientific Director of Indiana University Network Science Institute IUNI Previously he was professor of complex systems at the Department of Com puter Science of Aalto University Finland Prof Fortunato got his PhD in Theoretical Particle Physics at the University of Bielefeld In Germany He then moved to the field of complex sys tems via a postdoctoral appointment at the School of Informatics and Computing of Indiana University His current focus areas are network science especially community detection in graphs computational social science and science of science His research has been published in leading journals including Nature Science PNAS Physical Review Letters Reviews of Modern Physics Physics Reports and has collected over 21 000 citations Google Scholar His review article Community detection in graphs Physics Reports 486 75 174 2010 is one of the best known and most cited papers in network science He received the Young Scientist Award for Socio and Econophysics 2011 a prize given by the German Physical Society for his outstanding contributions to the physics of social systems 5
