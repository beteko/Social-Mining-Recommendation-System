University Cluj Napoca 3 Northwestern University Illinois Abstract The environment around us is progressively equipped with various sensors producing data continuously The applications using these data face many challenges such as data stream integration over an attribute such as time and knowledge extraction from raw data In this paper we propose one approach to face those two challenges First data streams integration is performed using statecharts which represents a resume of data produced by the corresponding data producer Second we detect anomalous events over temporal relations among statecharts We describe our approach in a demonstration scenario that is using a visual tool called Patternator 1 Introduction The physical space surrounding us is progressively equipped with different sensors giving us a digital view projection of the real world These sensors produce raw data streams such as temperature values images and badge readings Still it remains difficult for humans to perceive interesting information from those raw data which are increasing in frequency and precision In this demonstration we propose a mechanism to describe the behavior of data streams based on statecharts We use the temporal attribute associated with a stream in order to detect relations between statecharts corresponding to non homogenous datasources The events non holding these relations are considered as anomalies 2 Statecharts modeling datasources In our vision a datasource is an abstraction for a fountain fabric of data entities in the environment Examples of datasources are the values read by a temperature sensor or the events produced by a badge reader We associate the entities produces by a datasource with the datasource itself These entities share the same structure associated with the datasource The time plays a role in the description of a datasource DS At every discrete moment t DS is in a state defined by the produced entity at the instant t The entities produced by a datasource associated with a timestamp form a data stream A datasource DS at a time t is a sequence of timestamped data entities sharing the same structure header Each data entity has values from the cartesian product nAAAR ����� 21 where �R denotes the set of all positive real numbers the time RNTI E 19 635 Detecting Anomalies in Data Streams using Statecharts domain and Ai corresponds to the domain of datasource attributes We consider the particular case where each domain Ai is categorical We consider a partition {S1 S2 … Sn} of the space A1×A2×…×An Each set Si will be called a state of the datasource DS The states S1 S2 … Sn forms the statechart associated to the datasource DS Each entity produced by DS will generate a transition in the associated statechart If the last produced entity is called ea and the new produced entity is eb then the added transition connects the two corresponding states containing these entities 2 1 Relations between statecharts The problem is the integration of datasources described by different structures The only information useful to link these datasources is the timestamp associated to each produced entity We use the timestamp to find define an inclusion relation between two states DS1 S1 denotes the state S1 of the statechart corresponding to the datasource DS1 DS1 S1 is included in the state DS2 S2 if for each time when DS1 is in S1 DS2 is in the state S2 For a predefined amount of data we detect all relations between the states composing the statecharts corresponding to studied datasources All new events non respecting these relations are qualified as anomalies 3 Prototype and demonstration scenario Our demonstration scenario aims at detecting anomalies in continuous data streams The streams have different structures and the timestamp is the single information used to link statecharts resuming these streams Comparing to other approaches we use an integration of metadata statecharts automatically built on data streams Another advantage of this approach the statecharts have a powerful visual expression useful for real time monitoring applications The proposed prototype reads raw data from different datasources over HTTP Scuturici 2009 It can also load timestamped data from a relational database Patternator automatically finds the relations between statecharts and suggests as anomalous events the events not respecting these relations As dataset we used a subset of the dataset presented in VAST 2009 The subset contains one month of badges readers traces and computer network communications in a building The goal is to detect suspect user behaviors and since the ground truth is known we can evaluate our results and compare them to other published results References Varun
