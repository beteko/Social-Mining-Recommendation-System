 Early Classification on Temporal Sequences Jian Pei Simon Fraser University Canada jpei cs sfu ca cs sfu ca âˆ¼jpei Summary Early classification of temporal sequences has applications in for example health infor matics intrusion detection anomaly detection and scientific and engineering sequence data monitoring In early classification instead of optimizing accuracy our goal is to produce clas sification as early as possible provided that the accuracy meets some expectation In this talk I will advocate early classification as an exciting and challenging research problem which has not been systematically studied in the literature I will discuss several interesting formu lations of the problem which provide complimentary features possibly desirable in different application scenarios I will also review some of our recent progress on this aspect Bibliography Jian Pei is currently an Associate Professor of Computing Science and the Associate Di rector Research and Industry Relations at the School of Computing Science Simon Fraser University Canada His research interests can be summarized as developing effective and effi cient data analysis techniques for novel data intensive applications Particularly he is currently interested in various techniques of data mining Web search information retrieval data wa rehousing online analytical processing and database systems as well as their applications in social networks health informatics business and bioinformatics His research has been sup ported extensively by government funding agencies and industry partners He has published prolifically in refereed journals and conferences has regularly served in the organization com mittees and the program committees of many international conferences and workshops and has been a reviewer for the leading academic journals in his fields He is an associate editor of several journals such as ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data TKDD and IEEE Transactions of Knowledge and Data Engineering TKDE He is a senior member of the Association for Computing Machinery ACM and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE He is the recipient of the British Columbia Innovation Council 2005 Young Innovator Award an NSERC 2008 Discovery Accelerator Supplements Award 100 awards cross the whole country 10 in computer science an IBM Faculty Award 2006 a KDD Best Application Paper Award 2008 a PAKDD Most Influential Paper Award 2009 and an IEEE Outstanding Paper Award 2007
