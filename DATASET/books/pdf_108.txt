53 RNTI E33Machine Learning Based Classification of Android Apps through Text Features Mohamed Guendouz Abdelmalek Amine Reda Mohamed Hamou GeCoDe Laboratory Tahar Moulay University of Saida Saida Algeria adresse email une page html 1 Introduction This paper deals with the problem of Android mobile apps classification using machine learning and text mining methods Our approach consists in applying some machine learning methods on text characteristics that are extracted from app’s description on Google Play Store Our proposed approach consists of two main phases First we collect information about apps from the Google Play store using a web crawler Then we extract some text information from this data In our case for each app we have extracted its description and its category Second we train different classifiers this step involves pre processing the text which includes removing URLs and digits tokenization and calculating TF*IDF to transfer text to a numeric vector which can be used as input for classifiers Finally to evaluate performance of our sys tem we have conducted various experiments on three real datasets using different evaluation metrics Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of our app classification framework Finally we evaluate our approach on three real datasets obtained results shows that the use of text features in classifying Android apps can performs well FIG 1 – Architecture of the proposed framework 429 Machine Learning Based Classification of Android Apps through Text Features 2 Experimental Results Since there are not any standard dataset or benchmark for this type of studies we had to create our own dataset We collected metadata of free Android Apps from the Google Play store this task was done automatically using a web crawler developed specially for this A total of 7893 Android Apps were collected categorized in 4534 Apps and 3305 Games We devised our dataset into three other dataset which are General dataset which contains all Apps classified in two classes App and Game Apps dataset which contains only Apps classified in nine classes COMMUNICATION EDUCATION ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA AND VIDEO MEDICAL PHOTOGRAPHY SOCIAL TOOLS WEATHER Games datast which contains only Games classified in six classes ARCADE EDUCATIONAL PUZZLE RACING SIMULATION SPORTS 2 1 Evaluation Metrics In order to evaluate performance and accuracy of our approach we choose a good num ber of well accepted evaluation metrics for classifiers including Precision Recall F Measure TPR true positive rate FPR false positive rate In the experiments we utilize ten fold cross validation to evaluate each classifier 2 2 Results and Analysis In this subsection we analyze results obtained from experiments we first evaluate classi fiers on the first dataset which contains all applications categorized only in two classes Apps and Games this means a binary class classification we evaluate performance of different clas sifiers like Naive Bayse SVM RandomForest The result shows that the Random Forest algorithm performed better than all other algo rithms the best result of F Measure is 0 971 obtained from Random Forest algorithm with 150 trees this means that a large number of samples 97 1% approximately have been correctly classified by our system We also note that the SVM algorithm performs good results with a value of F Measure equal to 0 963 and a small value of FP rate equal to 0 042 this is due to the high classification accuracy of SVM algorithm in binary class classification We performed a second experiment on two other real datasets the first contains only An droid Apps of type App categorized in nine categories which means nine classes the second dataset contains only Android Apps of type Game categorized in six categories which means six classes therefore the problem is not anymore a binary class classification These results show that there is a decline in classifiers accuracy especially the Naive Bayes algorithm and this is due to the number of classes in each dataset and also because terms text used in describing these Apps are not different for example the term "play" is used to describes games which belong to different game categories like puzzle simulation and more this distribution of terms over multiple classes report incorrect classification results Although the Random Forest algorithm performs well and better than all other algorithms and gives good classification accuracy 430
