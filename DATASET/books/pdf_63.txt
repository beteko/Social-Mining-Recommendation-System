Time is an indispensable component of CH information implement ing appropriate knowledge models carry crucial importance in order to provide deeper understanding of heritage elements’ evolution to uncover concurrences and to weigh quality factors It is a challenging task though due to the uncertain characteristics of temporal data and to the wording of time in the CH discourse Existing KR models are either not designed for these distinctive characteristics or spatial aspects tend to upstage the temporal dimension This research aims at deciphering and proposing a formal representation of the way temporal hints are formalized in historical narratives An OWL ontology is introduced that provides a core support mechanism allowing for a semantic representation of temporal statements and for structural analysis The objective is to facilitate the cross examination of temporal hints in and across CH collections so that specialists can have extensive reading possibilities of heritage information 1 Introduction As pointed out by Jurisica et al 2004 with more and more computer readable pieces of information analysts today need to rethink their knowledge extraction strategies Ontolo gies offer significant capabilities for knowledge management especially in large volumes of information Davies et al 2003 by providing controlled and consistent vocabularies defined as a set of representational primitives information types their properties and relationships coherent with the meanings and constraints in a domain of knowledge Gruber 1993 On the other hand time is a feature that appears in many pieces of information Faucher et al 2010 and ontologies of time can be of concern for various disciplines In this research we focus on the concept of time in the cultural heritage CH discourse temporal aspects are there an inseparable and central role player for historical analysis and in any reasoning task performed on the evolution transformation reuse status of heritage assets But in the CH discourse past events or facts anchored in time in a large variety of forms e g [ ] it goes back to the second half of the 13th or 14th Century [ ] after the Revolution etc These wordings do not fit into “classical” quantification systems such as date formats in DB management systems e g “1942 03 19” 71 Temporal hints in the cultural heritage discourse In order to reach a more accurate representation of the temporal dimension of historic narratives it is important to analyze with care the actual wording of the temporal hints Only once this analysis has been carried out and confronted to the reality of the historical data sets can one expect to build a generic formal model providing interoperable means to decipher and represent temporal structures The idea behind the research is that as analysts of historical evidence and prior to any interpretation steps we first need to understand and depict in a structured and sharable manner the nature of the data we handle in particular of temporal statements Such a formalization targets reasoning tasks on verbalization patterns correlating them to types of information providers to historical periods they concern to particular geographic or cultural areas to particular authors etc The background objective of this research is to do a comprehensive analysis of the temporal hints in the CH discourse To do so we introduce a hands on application scenario encompassing the extraction of “real” hints from “real” data and an experimental implementation using the OWL Web Ontology Language Protégé tech nological suite Musen 2015 Such an ontology not only helps reaching a formal model of time as it is worded but also renews the way heritage specialists extract different interpretations from the data they handle We however make no claim that we have developed a generic ontological framework that would be suited to historic sciences at large We do acknowledge the fact that temporalities and the way they are worded can be dependent on distinctive parameters such as region ty pology or collection Nevertheless we highlight particular tendencies of wording in the CH discourse and focus on typical challenges while acquiring and formalizing temporal informa tion in the domain In Section 2 we draw the outline of the research context in a twofold manner first by outlining how the time concept is handled in the general research context and second by focusing on what has been experimented so far in the specific context of the CH domain Section 3 introduces our approach to the representation of time as it is worded concepts notions and their interrelations Section 4 discusses the technical implementation and its experimental evaluation In the final section we list outcomes and shortcomings at this stage of the research and some lessons learnt from the experiment 2 State of the art Useful standards definitions specifications and recommendations already exist aiming at diverse concerns and steps of temporal information processing Time oriented data analy sis is a concern within many research communities such as the TIME community that deals with temporal theories logics representation languages reasoning and ontologies Ermolayev et al 2014 ISO 8601 describes a standardized way of presenting dates and times whereas ISO 19108 sets the information technology standards for the interchanging of temporal in formation ISO TimeML targets a very crucial concern Natural Language Processing NLP tasks for creating controlled temporal expressions from unstructured text It does not only take into account quantities but also relevant semantic operators OWL Time which is a candidate W3C recommendation aims at providing a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological relations among temporal instants and intervals It has been recently extended Cox 2016 to support the encoding of temporal reference systems other than the Gregorian calendar There is a growing interest on extending regular time concept to a wider non absolute perspective 72 G Saygi et al i e research dealing with dirty datasets For instance Tao et al 2010 develop an ontology called CNTRO for representing temporal information in clinical narratives as RDF Resource Description Framework triples supporting time oriented queries in semantic web Anagnos topoulos et al 2013 draw attention to the frequency of qualitative expressions in temporal expressions e g before after and develop a reasoner named CHRONOS for uncovering temporal relations Golden and Shaw 2016 ease the task of linking among datasets that de fine temporal periods differently Poveda Villalón et al 2014 highlight the importance of integrating recurrent events whereas Diallo et al 2015 consider different granularities in ad dition to recurrences Faucher et al 2010 experiment a pipeline from bottom to top i e for acquiring temporal knowledge from texts in order to populate a constrained computable model Nevertheless uncertainty vagueness and imprecision in the wording of temporal hints e g late 1980s end of November remain tough to represent formally Besides none of the above mentioned research works yet take into account contradictory notations or alterna tive wordings that can be combined even in a single source e g in the 14th Century probably around 1380 although such ways of saying are common in the CH discourse In the CH domain the CIDOC CRM also known as ISO 21127 is a core ontological model aiming at creating semantic glue between different sources of information such as that published by museums libraries and archives In CRM model spatiality and temporality go hand in hand Particular to CRM based experimentations some researchers represented tem poral periods on 4 dimensional volumes Papadakis et al 2014 being associated with spatio temporalities Hiebel et al 2016 Approximate definite and indefinite bounds of periods are considered Although they state the approach could be embedded in an information system such as GIS there is no solid test case yet Moreover Papadakis et al 2014 point out that their model does not allow representing periods which retreat to the same place several times i e recurrent events or occur at disjoint places e g festive events This is a quite critical issue in CH considering for example sets of transformations additions extensions shaping a heritage artefact’s lifespan They focus on modeling reality using only material evidence about past periods or events derived from the observation of traces However although time may leave physical traces on tangible heritage assets it does not always do so in particular in the case of intangible heritage e g practices traditions festive events Binding 2010 adopt CRM entities and properties for controlled vocabularies and demonstrate a temporal reason ing method for modelling temporal relationships for archaeological records They make use of conventional agreements for temporal subdivisions This allows aligning data records with known time periods and representing the approximate lower and upper bounds of the time pe riods with numeric values For instance they split centuries into years of 01 32 if indicated early 33 66 for mid or 67 100 for late with reference to advice received from English Her itage As shown in Section 3 1 our contribution reuses this concept of conventional mapping agreements but extends it in terms of granularities and proposes a level of flexibility that allows for a user chosen or user specific conventional mapping Kauppinen et al 2010 stress the imprecision of temporal information in the CH dis course They deal with fuzzy boundaries and exact boundaries of time intervals and for malize each temporal interval by constraining the earliest and latest possible start and end dates Nevertheless they do not take into account open end indications like before and after statements Besides they solely analyze the potential overlapping of intervals Nurminen and Heimburger 2012 discuss representation and retrieval of uncertain temporal information in 73 Temporal hints in the cultural heritage discourse museum databases with a specific focus on anchored time intervals They underline the shift from item centric i e structured around physical entities to event centric cataloguing i e concentrating on various events of museum artefacts It is particularly important when con sidering events as clusters linking heritage entities to the cultural actions of human beings and the social setting Generally speaking a large number of research efforts on temporal reasoning build on the concepts introduced by Allen 1983 1991 and there is no doubt that such efforts are welcome for instance in the context of artificial intelligence applications But there is quite a distance between the way historical hints are actually worded and a sound application of Allen’s for mal relations Our research fits in that gap temporal statements both quantitative values and lexical modifiers first need to undergo a process of extraction in order to uncover their struc ture and a fine grain analysis so that scientists can get a critical understanding of how doubts pervade their reasoning processes This key challenge in historical sciences was taken on in the context of heritage data cross examination and visualization Blaise et al 2016 but an in depth investigation of how it can be addressed in the KR context remains to be carried out Efficient temporal reasoning based on Allen’s relations or not will only be possible if a com plete formal model of the specific wordings of historians has been introduced In order to fulfill this aspect a basic approach could be following the footsteps of a standard temporal ontology such as OWL Time by extending it or reusing the spatio temporal ontology by CIDOC CRM Nevertheless the way time is verbalized in the historical discourse would require a very signif icant move away from these standards’ original versions The approach presented in this paper is not to work on the concept of time itself or on spatio temporal entities but to try and assess the potential added value of a formal representation of temporal statements as worded in the CH discourse 3 Analysis and representation of temporal statements In this section we discuss the formal model of temporal statements To start with we define the main notions the top level organization and relations and detail the time related concepts classification 3 1 Main notions and general organization of the formal model A TemporalStatement is some sequence of words that tell us when something hap pened and or how long something lasted within a temporal reference A TemporalStatement’s seman tic field is the notion of time alone it does not extend to the concept of spatial physical property which it affects or refers to Any TemporalStatement is composed of one or more time related concepts points intervals etc which may be accompanied by one or more LexicalOperators during before end of etc There is a set of basic but important elements we associate to a temporal statement figure 1 First and foremost granularity describes the mapping of time into conventional units upon human decision That mapping is basically aimed at dealing with time in an easier way and can be specified in multiple ways in larger or smaller units depending on the needs of the analyst Aigner et al 2011 In a TemporalStatement like “The first quotation dates back to 20 April 1687” the temporal granularity can be fixed to “a day” But the day can be subdivided into 74 G Saygi et al smaller segments such as 24 hours or 1440 minutes and incidentally the “standardization” of time dates back to 1884 with the definition of an “average” hour in response to the multiplicity and variability of solar hours hence serious interpretation bottlenecks when observing such statements today The non decomposable unit for a given granularity is called chronon a term coined by Lévi 1927 For instance in Java date class uses milliseconds as chronon Naturally in the historical discourse there can be a disjunction between a statement’s intrinsic granularity and the temporality of the fact that is reported For instance in a temporal statement like “A great fire damaged the building extensively in the winter of 1920” the granularity of the statement is a season whereas the “great fire” mentioned in the statement most probably lasted some days at most or even some hours The notion of UnfoldableTimePoint see Section 3 1 3 is a pragmatic answer to that concern 1855 1860 1858 1860 Time related Concepts ConventionalMapping Agreement Lexical Operator Named TimePeriod Quantified TemporalStatement TemporalStatement end of the 1850 s isPartOf isPartOf isTranslatedByUsing IntervalInterval isUsedforExpressing user A isInterpretedBy refersTo refersTo user B Compound TemporalStatement FIG 1 Components of a TemporalStatement and their interrelations A difference is made between Temporal Reference Systems calendars part of OWL Time and the notion of periodization in history that can be used as a reference in the wording of tem poral hints but that is not a systematic discretization of time e g Gothic appears before Re naissance in European architectural styles nevertheless we can not specify the exact temporal boundaries of these trends This notion is mapped in a concept called NamedTimePeriod Consequently the proposed model is organized as follows — A LexicalOperator concept matching the “verbal modifiers” around before etc — A utility concept called ConventionalMapping used to interpret qualitative expressions when needed and turn them into workable quantities — Classes that represent the time related concepts present in the TemporalStatements 3 1 1 LexicalOperator Lexicals refining the qualitative extent of time and supporting the anchoring of Temporal Statements are defined as LexicalOperators table 1 These qualitative components of the hint determine the “extent” of a TemporalStatement 75 Temporal hints in the cultural heritage discourse Type of usage Defines quantity by Examples ExplicitOperator covers the words that do not impact the worded quantity Pointing at in || on || at Bounding from to || between end Defining frequency every || annually ImpreciseOperator enlarges or extends the worded quantity Anchoring at a median point around || about || towards Bounding at one direction before || after || since RefinementOperator narrows the extent of the TemporalStatement by creating a subdivision Ordering Subdivisions early || latebeginning of || end of middle of Natural Subdivisions seasons || tides TAB 1 Types of LexicalOperators acting as potential components of TemporalStatements 3 1 2 ConventionalMapping Prior to any conversion of a temporal statement containing a lexical operator into a work able quantity an ad hoc convention should be established this is the role played by Conven tionalMapping agreements The quantification of any LexicalOperator is subject to Conven tionalMapping CM For instance “end of the 15th century” can be translated into a user chosen quantified time slot as “1480 1500” and the analyst needs to formalize in a sustainable manner such a decision 3 1 3 Time related Concepts Time related concepts are represented through three major classes hierarchy of classes NamedTimePeriod QuantifiedTemporalStatement CompoundTemporalStatement In this sec tion we address their definitions properties and specifications NamedTimePeriod NamedTimePeriods correspond to TemporalStatements that provide an ordered reference rather than a temporal coordinate system e g after the reign of rather than between X and Y The sequence of NamedTimePeriods can overlap on each other It can be related to diverse frame of references such as art movements e g Art Nouveau political events e g 30 Year Wars or natural facts A NamedTimePeriod whether it is accompanied with a LexicalOperator or not implies the use of CM The concept matches the notion of periodization in historical analyses QuantifiedTemporalStatement A QuantifiedTemporalStatement is a temporal hint expressed in numbers or with universally accepted lexicals such as a decade It can represent either a TimePoint an Interval or an UnanchoredDuration A QuantifiedTemporalStatement has two properties a temporal reference system and a chronon Although the QuantifiedTemporal Statement is the quantified part of a hint its value should still be interpreted in relation with any LexicalOperator present in the statement e g “before 1650” does not point out to “the year of 1650” itself but to a “time slot that precedes 1650” 76 G Saygi et al TimePoint definition and subclasses At the conceptual level a time point represents an instant with a zero length Depending on the granularity a TimePoint de facto can have a temporal extent Three concepts refining the classic TimePoint tp class are introduced to deal with temporal statements that are verbalized as TimePoints table 2 FuzzyTemporalStatement tpF is a wording that refers to an event confined in an ambiguous way to a TimePoint The fuzziness of the information delivered by such a TemporalStatement comes from a doubt concerning the alignment of the granularity possibly needed to analyze the event and this of the TimePoint g ≥ g W E g E g W … tpF worded granularity granularity of the event Example Elle a été reconstruite au milieu du 18e siècle The edifice was built between 12th and 13th Centuries Extraction [tpF] = middle of the 18th century and [gW]= a century ≥ [gE]= a year UnfoldableTemporalStatement tpU is a wording that refers to an event expressed as a TimePoint Unlike in the case of FuzzyTemporalStatement the duration of the event is here for sure shorter than the chronon corresponding to the TimePoint … g ≥ g W E EW tpF worded granularity granularity of the event g g Example La toiture a été emportée par l’avalanche de 1978 The roof was washed away by the avalanche of 1978 Extraction [tpU] = the avalanche of 1978 and [gW]= a year > [gE]= a minute RecurrentTemporalStatement tpR is dedicated to TemporalStatements for peri odic cyclic occurrences Its structure is as same as the TimePoint but with frequency descriptors f tp R f f f f t Example Aujourd’hui Notre Dame de Vie fait toujours [ ] annuel le 15 août Today Notre Dame de Vie is still [ ] an annual pilgrimage on August 15th Extraction [tpR] = August 15th and [f] = annual TAB 2 Subclasses of TimePoint 77 Temporal hints in the cultural heritage discourse Interval definition and subclasses At the conceptual level a time interval represents a segment of time with a duration Six concepts are introduced to deal with temporal statements that are verbalized as time intervals table 3 They share common features they are defined by one or two TimePoints and are anchored in time ProperIntervalStatement iPR is a wording corresponding to an Interval expressed with 2 TimePoints beginning boundary tpB and end boundary tpE These two TimePoints are connected by an ExplicitOperator d tp B tp E tp E tp B iPR lexical operator e g from…to t occurrence interval Example [ ] Bâti en pierre entre 1815 et 1825 [ ] Built in stone between 1815 and 1825 Extraction [tpB] = 1815 and [tpE] = 1825 implies d = [tpE] [tpB] + 1 = 11 years OnePointAnchoredIntervalStatement iOPA is a wording that refers to an occurrence expressed by a TimePoint and accompanied by a LexicalOperator such as “around” The LexicalOperator’s effect is to create two equal durations d on both sides of the point The value of the durations is user chosen ConventionalMapping d tp M i OPA lexical operator e g around d M tp t Example Bâtiment actuel édifié autour de 1645 Current building is built around 1645 Extraction [tpM] = 1815 and [d] is related to CM OneSideBoundedIntervalStatement iOSB is a wording that refers to an occurrence expressed by a TimePoint tp and accompanied by a LexicalOperator such as “be fore” or “after” The TimePoint acts as a boundary beginning or end and the Lexical Operator’s effect is to create an undefined duration on one side A conventional value for the duration can be defined by ConventionalMapping tp iOSB lexical operator e g before d lexical operator e g after t t Example Elle a été construite après 1720 par souscription publique It was built after 1720 by public subscription Extraction [tp] = 1720 and [d] is related to CM Continued on next page 78 G Saygi et al RelativeIntervalStatement iR is a wording where a TimePoint is used to anchor an occurrence located at a distance in the past or in the future of the TimePoint The “tem poral gap” between the TimePoint and the occurrence is expressed but the duration of the occurrence is not tp iR lexical operator e g x years before lexical operator e g x years after t t d Example en 1706 la chapelle ste Anne [ ] bt̂ie depuis plus de 60 ans in 1706 the chapel ste Anne [ ] built more than 60 years ago Extraction [tp] = 1706 and [d] = more than 60 years PertinentIntervalStatement iPE is a wording where one only boundary is defined and by an instance of NamedTimePeriod “WWII” “the great plague” etc The concept is used to refine iOSB and iR when the anchoring cannot be done through a TimePoint but is done through an instance of NamedTimePeriod ntp i PE lexical operator e g x years before lexical operator e g x years after t t named time period d Example [ ] remaniements après la Révolution [ ] rearrengements after the Revolution Extraction [ntp] = the Revolution and [d] and [ntp] are related to CM UnfoldableIntervalStatementt iU is a wording expressed with two TimePoints and where the duration of the occurrence is for sure shorter than the distance separating the two TimePoints tp B tp E tp B lexical operator e g from…to i U tp E t t d Example 1160 1164 [ ] seigneurs [ ] pour y construire une abbaye acte signé [ ] 1160 1164 lords [ ] to build an abbey [ ] deed signed [ ] Extraction [tpB] = 1160 and [tpE] = 1164 implies [d] = 5 years > [dEVENT] TAB 3 Subclasses of Interval UnanchoredDuration An UnanchoredDuration represents any temporal statement that men tions a segment of time with a duration but without explicit boundaries anchored in time This concept is used to represent hints such as “the renovation lasted for 40 days ” 79 Temporal hints in the cultural heritage discourse CompoundTemporalStatement It is quite common to have multiple temporal indications within one TemporalStatement e g “it dates back to the 13th or 14th century” CompoundTem poralEntity represents such cases in which the statement contains two or more alternative QuantifiedTemporalEntities may they overlap or not and may they be consistent in terms of wording or not 4 OWL Implementation results and limitations We implemented an open source solution by using OWL 2 built upon the RDF standard in which data is represented by sets of “triples” We populated the ontology with information extracted from online resources published by different stakeholders e g public archives cul tural societies etc harvested in the context of a research initiative 1 on minor tangible and intangible heritage These information sets being verbalized by various parties correspond to the heterogonous imprecise and uncertain nature of the temporal information often met in the CH domain We selected 1576 statements and in addition to standard OWL data types we reused OWL time datatypes such as time generalDay time generalMonth At this still early stage of the research the formalization effort does shed light on some significant verbalization patterns but also on where the effort needs to be consolidated For instance 90 TemporalStatements correspond to the concept of CompoundTemporalStatement but their classification as such is motivated either by contradictory indications “ [ ]datées du XIème ou du XIIème siècle” or by a sort of caution in the wording “ [ ] doit remonter au XVIIe siècle vers 1668 1670 ” Incidentally the use of wordings classified as CompoundTem poralStatement apparently gets more common when occurrences are located farther in the past which is a rather expected pattern A majority of the overall statements considered fall into one class the FuzzyTemporalStatement class This also is rather expected since the granularity alignment between a hint and an occurrence is quite often out of reach in Historical Sciences and in particular when dealing with Minor Heritage Some more question opening tenden cies can be observed also for instance when observing the variety of linguistic figures used to verbalize one same situation bounding the “beginning” of an occurrence But it has to be said clearly that tendencies observed could very well be related to the particular dataset we have worked on or to biases introduced in the model itself and therefore they should be taken for what they are worth Our purpose is certainly not to draw out of such early observations a Historical Sciences related general conclusion but by contrast to use the observations as a mean to question the model In addition one of the lessons learnt from the experimentation was that some “contemporary” hints as found in citizen birthed e sources harvested on the net such as “the edifice was reconstructed in last years” are far from being the easiest to deal with Briefly said our formalization efforts do highlight the extreme diversity of temporal in formation in the CH discourse but also uncover some significant patterns such as a relative disconnection between lexical operators and temporal granularity operators used whatever granularity As a consequence it appears clearly that what the research also underlines is the amount of unsaid in the reasons why this or that verbalization modality has been chosen by an information provider 1 The ontology is available on the Territographie project web site map cnrs fr territographie portal of an exploratory research project on citizen science and minor heritage conducted in co operation with MuCEM Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilizations and funded by the région Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur authorities 80 G Saygi et al 5 Conclusions and Future Works In this paper we analyzed imperfect temporal statements used in the CH discourse and introduced an ontology for enabling and encoding temporal knowledge Our contribution small though it may be aims at facilitating the cross examination by analysts of historical evidence of the temporal evidence itself prior to interpretation steps Our experimental results show that the ontology carries the potential to shed light on ill defined temporal information effectively Nevertheless we acknowledge the necessity to validate the ontology on larger datasets and test its extraction capability in heritage collections where regional and typological parameters are extensively circumscribed In addition we acknowledge the necessity to inspect the proposed ontology by external do main experts However the services expected as well as the information providers correspond to a variety of domains ranging from linguistics “wording as such” to museology ethnol ogy art history if not historical sciences at large etc Hence a robust validation helping to recalibrate the proposition will require a multidisciplinary investigation and is definitely part of the research agenda we have ahead of us Future works will include a critical analysis of the applicability of the approach beyond the initial corpus rules of assignment in particular a visualization effort and a deeper attention to the interdisciplinary issue of elicitation not only how a temporal statement is worded but also why References Aigner W S Miksch H Schumann and C Tominski 2011 Visualization of time oriented data Springer

l’analyser que pour relier des faits isolés Mais la façon dont cette dimension est verbalisée pose des problèmes de formalisation non tri viaux Pourtant cette verbalisation que l’on associe souvent au terme chapeau d’incertitude peut être lue en dissociant d’une part le caractère mal connu d’un fait documenté irréductible et les choix faits par le producteur de l’information pour la relativiser Dans cette contribution nous proposons un modèle formel permettant d’observer et d’analyser de façon systématique cette couche de verbalisation L’expérience est menée sur des données fortement hétérogènes souvent d’origine citoyenne documentant le petit patrimoine matériel et immatériel Ce cas d’étude est donc limité mais il apparait néanmoins comme portant une question de fond allant au delà du cas d’espèce La contribution détaille d’abord la grille d’analyse d’indices tempo rels proposée puis relate l’expérimentation concrète associée ontologie OWL Il n’est pas fait état d’une quelconque prétention à un résultat généralisable stricto sensu mais cette expé rience peut contribuer à nourrir de façcon pragmatique un débat nécessaire sur la formalisation d’indices temporels dans les sciences historiques 82
