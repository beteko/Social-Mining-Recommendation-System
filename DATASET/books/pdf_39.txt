 Long range influences in social networks Ernesto Estrada ERNESTO ESTRADA Department of Mathematics and Statistics University of Strathclyde 26 Richmond Street Glasgow G1 1XH UK ernesto estrada strath ac uk Summary In this talk I will introduce some problems that motivate the necessity of considering non random long range influences in social interactions This motivation will be developed on the basis of the diffusion of innovations in social networks and a couple of examples will be provided Then I will develop a mathematical framework that allow to generalise the Laplacian operator on networks and propose a generalised diffusion equation on graphs I will prove analytically that in one and two dimensional cases this new scheme gives rise to superdiffusive behaviours on networks I will show how to extend this model to a random multi hopper to be applied in real world networks Finally I will return to the problem of social systems showing some implications of the new model for selection of leaders influence of leaders cohesiveness and diffusion of innovations Biography Ernesto Estrada has an internationally leading reputation for shaping and developing the study of complex networks His expertise ranges in the areas of network structure algebraic network theory dynamical systems on networks and the study of random models of networks He has a distinguished track record of high quality publications which has attracted more than 10 000 citations His h index number of papers with at least h citations is 56 His publica tions are in the areas of network theory and its applications to social ecological engineering physical chemical and biological real world problems Professor Estrada has published two text books on network sciences both published by Oxford University Press in 2011 and 2015 respectively He has demonstrated a continuous international leadership in his field where he has been invited and plenary speaker at the major conferences in network sciences and applied mathematics He is the Editor in Chief of the Journal of Complex Networks Oxford Univer sity Press as well as an Editor of SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics and of Proceedings of the Royal Society A 3
