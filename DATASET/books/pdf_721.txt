in semi structured documents In this paper we present the SHIRI 1 querying approach which allows to reach more or less structured document parts without an a priori knowledge on their structuring 1 Approximate Queries According to Document Structuring To retrieve the most suited tagged element according to a user query classical approaches tend to use a statistical indexing of the tagged zones But while such indexing has shown to be very efficient for document retrieval it remains unsatisfying for element retrieval Cases where the query is composed of many terms which are not necessarily localized in the same parts of the documents are not well covered Furthermore even if the neighboring tags are taken into account through an in document distance the ranking of the retrieved parts does not embed any notion of structuring e g a document node talking only about a conference A may have the same rank as a node talking about three different conferences We propose a semantic solution to cope with structures heterogeneity by making explicit the structuring levels [Thiam et al 2008 ] A document node is so said to be a part of speech i e annotated by the PartOfSpeech metadata if it contains many instances of different con cepts Another node containing only one single instance of a given concept is annotated as being an instance of that concept and respectively for the SetOf case where a node contains a set of instances of the same type Furthermore the structural imbrication between document nodes is used to infer semantic relations between the annotated instances E g if the node ’< ul >’ is annotated as an instance of the ’Article’ concept and the next ’< li >’ node is annotated as an instance of the Person concept the relation < ul authored_by li > is created Referring to the above annotation model we propose two approximation types The first called aggregative approximation uses the aggregate metadata defined in the ontology extension PartOfSpeech and SetOfConcepti to look for less structured document parts if no better structuring is found The second approximation called neighboring approximation is used to cover cases where we look for semantic relations that are not retrieved in the anno tation base i e there is no imbrication between two document nodes which are annotated 1SHIRI Digiteo labs project LRI SUPELEC Aggregative and Neighboring Approximations to Query Semi Structured Documents respectively by the domain and range of the relation The queries we consider are in RDF triple pattern e g SPARQL queries For instance the query < x type Article > AND < x authoredby y > AND < y hasName ”V ictor V ianu” > should return parts of documents which are imbricated in an appropriate manner and annotated by the appropriate concept types according to the query However this structuring is highly binding Our first approximation type allows to search for document parts annotated by aggregates instead of the initial concepts specified by the user query A first approximation of the query above can so be < x type Article> AND < x authored_by_Set y> AND < y type SetOfAuthors> A second can be to search for a PartOfSpeech metadata indexed by the Article and Author concepts From another hand the neighboring approximation allows to replace the wished imbrication by a more general structural neighboring In example the query above could be approximated by replacing the triple < x authored_by y > by < x ParentOf [N ] y > The ParentOf [N ] relation represents the fact that the structural unit x and y are at a dis tance N of each other e g <table tr[1] td[3]> is at a distance 3 from <table tr[2] td[1]> In our first experimentations we proposed a dynamic algorithm which combines the two ap proximations types and returns results of the original query and its ranked approximations We tested this approach on three distinct annotated data sources bibliographic references from DBLP HAL and INRIA server The results we obtained after applying a set of more or less complicated queries showed that our approach makes it possible to reach heterogeneous data structures without an a priori knowledge We had an overall recall of 28% with the original query 19 9% with the aggregative approximation 52 3% with the neighboring approximations and 72% with the combined approximations Overlapping put away the total recall of three approximations is of 100% The precision was also of 100% due to structures regularity of the corpus we used Contextually our approach doesn’t replace ontology based approximations proposed in [Hurtado et al 2006 Corby et al 2006 ] It applies as an independent layer to cope with structures heterogeneity Future works will encompass the enhancement of our ranking criteria the experimentation with irregular document structures and an unsupervised annotation process References Corby O R Dieng Kuntz F Gandon and C Faron Zucker 2006 Searching the semantic web Approximate query processing based on ontologies IEEE intelligent
