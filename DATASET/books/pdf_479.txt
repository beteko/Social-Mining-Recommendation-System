 Relational Learning from Spatial Data Retrospect and Prospect Donato Malerba University of Bari malerba di uniba it di uniba it ~malerba Summary Learning from spatial data is characterized by two main features First spatial objects have a locational property which implicitly defines several spatial relationships topological direc tional distancebased between objects Second attributes of spatially related units tend to be statistically correlated These two features argue against the assumption of the independent generation of data samples i i d assumption underlying classic machine learning algorithms and motivate the application of relational learning algorithms whose inferences are based on both instance properties and relations between data This relational learning approach to spa tial domains has already been investigated in the last decade and important accomplishments in this direction have already been performed In this talk we retrospectively survey major achievements on relational learning from spatial data and we report open problems which still challenges researchers and prospectively suggest important topics for incorporation into a re search agenda Bibliography Donato Malerba is a full professor at the Department of Informatics University of Bari where he teaches in the courses of "Algorithms and Data Structures" "Advanced Data Base Systems" and "Knowledge Bases and Data Mining" In 1992 he was assistant specialist at the Institute of Computer Science University of California Irvine His research activity mainly concerns machine learning and data mining in particular numeric symbolic methods for in ductive inference classification and model trees multi relational data mining spatial data mining web mining and their applications to intelligent document processing and digital map interpretation He has published more than 150 papers in international journals and conference proceedings He was in the Management Board of the European Coordinated Action FP6 021321 "KDUbiq Knowledge Discovery in Ubiquitous Environments" December 2005 May 2008 and in the Management Board of the European project IST 2001 33086 "KDNet European Knowledge Discovery Network of Excellence" 2002 2004 He participated to several European and National projects He was responsible of the unit of Bari in the Euro pean project IST 1999 10536 SPIN Spatial Mining on Data of Public Interest and in two 5 MIUR COFIN projects years 1999 2001 2001 2003 He is responsible of a research unit of the strategic project PS121 "Telecommunication Facilities and Wireless Sensor Networks in Emergency Management" funded by Apulia Region He has received the IBM Faculty Award for the year 2004 He has been in the executive board of the Italian Association for Arti ficial Intelligence AI*IA from September 2001 till September 2005 He has served in the program committee of many international conferences and workshops of machine learning and data mining co chaired seven international national workshops and acted as guest editor of six special issues of international journals topics machine learning in computer vision mining official data visual data mining spatio temporal data mining artificial intelligence multi relational data mining He was program co chair of the 18th International Conference on Industrial Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems IEA AIE’05 Bari June 2005 and of the 16th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems ISMIS’06 Bari September 2006 He is program co chair of the confer ence ECML PKDD which will be held in Athens Greece next September 2011 He is in the editorial board of Machine Learning Journal Journal of Intelligent Information Systems and International Journal of Data Mining Modelling and Management 6
