 A Clustering Based Approach for Type Discovery in RDF Data Sources Kenza Kellou Menouer Zoubida Kedad PRISM University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines 45 avenue des Etats Unis Versailles France kenza menouer prism uvsq fr zoubida kedad prism uvsq fr Querying and exploiting RDF S OWL data sources requires information about the re sources and properties they contain Without a description of the data set it is difficult to target the relevant properties and resources and browsing data sets in order to understand their con tent can be a tedious process One important feature of RDF S OWL data sources is that they are not organized according to any predefined schema They are structureless by nature and the languages used to describe data on the Web do not impose any constraints or restrictions on the properties describing resources Our goal is to discover missing type definitions in a RDF S OWL data set We propose a clustering based approach where entities are grouped according to their similarity The sim ilarity between two given entities is evaluated considering their respective sets of properties using Jaccard similarity Our requirements for type discovery are the followings firstly the number of types is not known in advance and secondly the data sets are evolving large and may contain noise The most suitable grouping approach is density based clustering introduced by Ester et al 1996 because it is robust to noise deterministic and it finds classes of arbitrary shape which is useful for data sets where resources are described with heterogeneous property sets In addition unlike the algorithms based on k means and k medoid the number of classes is not required In order to speed up the clustering process and especially to perform successive executions with different parameters values the maximum radius of neighborhood ε and the minimum number of neighbors for an entity MinPts we perform once and for all the calculation of the nearest neighbors of each entity To this end we index the data and we order the entities according to their similarity We store a neighborhood matrix containing for each entity the ordered list of its neighbors as well as the distance between this entity list and the number of the line representing the index of an entity Thanks to the indexing of the data and the ordering of the neighbors according to the distance it is not necessary to go through the entire matrix to find the neighbors of a given entity and the complexity of neighbors search becomes linear o n We have performed some experiments on existing data sets to assess the quality of the in ferred types We have extracted the existing type definitions from our data sets and considered them as a gold standard Then we have run our algorithm on the data sets without the type def initions and evaluated for each of the inferred classes precision and recall We have annotated each inferred class with the most frequent type definition of its entities For each type label Tr 471 Type Discovery in RDF Data Sources of size nr in the data set and each class Ci of size ni inferred by our approach such that Tr is the label of Ci the quality metrics are evaluated for each Ci with respect to Tr as follows nri being the number of instances in the class Ci that belong to Tr the precision P Tr Ci is defined as nri ni the recall R Tr Ci is defined as nri nr In addition to achieve good pre cision and recall even when the sets of properties describing entities are very heterogeneous the approach enabled to infer type definitions which were not specified in the data set Some works in the literature have addressed the problem of inferring type of a semi structured data set Wang et al 2000 propose an approximate DataGuide based on COBWEB but it is not deterministic expensive and not very suitable for large data sets The proposed algorithm in Nestorov et al 1998 uses bottom up grouping However the method requires a threshold of similarity and the number of classes Christodoulou et al 2013 use ascending hierarchical clustering to deduce structural summaries of linked data Unlike our approach only outgoing properties are considered and the hierarchical clustering is very expensive SD Type Paulheim and Bizer 2013 enriches an entity by several types using RDFS inference rules and computes the confidence of a type for an entity The contribution is more to evaluate the relevance of inferred types for an entity rather than to find its type as RDFS inference rules are used for this In future works we will address the generation of fuzzy classes to allow multiple types for an entity We will also tackle the annotation of the extracted classes as well as the discovery of possible links between them in order to produce a complete schema description References Christodoulou K N W Paton and A A Fernandes 2013 Structure inference for linked data sources using clustering In Proceedings
