 Towards a New Science of Big Data Analytics based on the Geometry and the Topology of Complex Hierarchic Systems Fionn Murtagh Royal Holloway University of London fionn cs rhul ac uk 1 Summary My work is concerned with pattern recognition knowledge discovery computer learning and statistics I address how geometry and topology can uncover and empower the semantics of data In addition to the semantics of data that can be explored using Correspondence Ana lysis and related multivariate data analyses hierarchy is a fundamental concept in this work I address not only low dimensional projection for display purposes but carry out search and pat tern recognition whenever useful in very high dimensional spaces High dimensional spaces present very different characteristics from low dimensions I have shown that in a particular sense very high dimensional space becomes as dimensionality increases hierarchical I have also shown how in hierarchy and hence in an ultrametric topological mapping of information space we track change or anomaly or rupture In this presentation the first theme discussed is that of linear time hierarchical clustering with application to sky survey data in astronomy and to chemo informatics The second theme discussed is computational text analysis It is interesting to note that J P Benzécri’s original motivation was in language and linguistics In my text analysis work I have taken the dictum of McKee Story Substance Structure Style and the Principles of Screenwriting Methuen 1999 that "text is the sensory surface of a work of art" and show just how this insight can be rendered in computational terms This leads to demarcating tracking statistical modelling visualizing and pattern recognition of narrative In an application to collaborative writing I developed an interactive framework for critiquing and assessing fit and appropriateness of content on the basis of semantics leading to books that were published as e books having been written by school children in a few days of collaborative class work In many aspects of this work hierarchy expresses both continuity and change in the textual narrative or in the narrative of chronological events 2 Biography Fionn Murtagh is Professor of Computer Science in the University of London at Royal Holloway cs rhul ac uk home fionn For the past 5 years he was directing Science Foundation Ireland’s funding programmes across a wide area including semantic and sensor web renewable energy nanotechnology and telecommunications In the past he has held Full Towards a New Science of Big Data Analytics Professor of Computer Science positions at Queen’s University Belfast and at the University of Ulster For 12 years he served in the Space Science Department of the European Space Agency based at the European Southern Observatory in Munich For many years he was an Adjunct Professor at Strasbourg Astronomical Observatory Université de Strasbourg Extensive visi ting positions were held at the Joint Research Centre Ispra Italy and in the Department of Statistics University of Washington Fionn Murtagh’s degrees are in Mathematics and Engineering Science BA BAI an MSc in Computer Science all from Trinity College Dublin a Doctorat de 3ème Cycle in Mathe matical Statistics from Université P M Curie Paris 6 and an HDR in Pattern Recognition in Astronomy from now Université de Strasbourg Fionn has been President of the Classifi cation Society formerly the Classification Society of North America and President of the British Classification Society He is an elected Member of the Royal Irish Academy a Fellow of the International Association for Pattern Recognition and a Fellow of the British Computer Society Fionn Murtagh is Editor in Chief of the Computer Journal the flagship journal of the Bri tish Computer Society published by Oxford University Press He is a member of the editorial boards of various journals including Pattern Recognition Journal of Classification and Neu rocomputing He has published 6 research monographs 125 journal papers 135 other papers in book compilations and conference proceedings and he has edited many books and journal special issues His Erdös number is 2
