starting from reconciled datasets whose objects are linked with semantic sameAs relations We attempt to merge the often conflicting information of these reconciled objects in order to obtain unified representations that only contain the best quality information 1 Introduction Data linking also known as data reconciliation Ferrara et al 2013 Saïs et al 2009 Pernelle et al 2013 is the process where two object descriptions are examined in order to determine whether they refer to the same real world entity and if so to link them together Then data fusion encompasses the effort to acquire a single homogenized object by merging the information of the linked individual objects The objects marked with the owl sameAs may contain different conflicting or inconsistent values in their properties For each property the most appropriate value must be chosen The data fusion is an essential step towards avoiding redundancy grouping together the best quality information and giving consistent answers to the users in the linked data environment Research on the data fusion problem has begun over two decades ago in the field of relatio nal databases Bleiholder et Naumann 2008 However as we examine the data fusion from the RDF point of view we notice that the specificities of RDF mechanisms cannot be reflected in solutions offered by relational databases experts Three main approaches have been proposed for data fusion in RDF Saïs et Thomopoulos 2008 Saïs et al 2010 Flouris et al 2012 Mendes et al 2012 These different approaches attempt to evaluate the quality of each value by taking into account various measures based on the value itself and or its metadata In this work we are interested in exploring the problem of data fusion Our method com bines different quality criteria based on the value and its data source and exploits whenever possible the ontology semantics constraints and relations What is more we create a mecha nism to provide explanations about the quality of each value as estimated by our system To achieve this we generate annotations used for traceability and explanation purposes Our approach is described in detail in Section 2 A first evaluation is presented in Section 3 Finally Section 4 concludes the paper and gives some future work 257 Linked Data Fusion 2 Proposed solution Inspired by the approaches cited in Section 1 we build a system that attempts to offer a solid automated solution to the fusion problem With respect to the description of conflict handling methods described in Bleiholder et Naumann 2008 our approach is automatic and applies a conflict resolution strategy We will show that it is at the same time an instance based and a metadata based strategy As it will be shown in the next sections this solution will i be adapted to each property ii exclude values that are implausible according to specific rules iii exploit whenever pos sible the ontology knowledge constraints relations etc and iv natively treat multi valued properties Most importantly it will store the information that led to each fusion decision in order to offer explanations on how and why a value has been chosen 2 1 Methodology Detect implausible values We use the notion of plausibility in order to exclude values that are irrational according to some measures or predefined logic rules This step is based on the following elements Frequency The measures of homogeneity and occurrence frequency in the data sources as defined in Saïs et Thomopoulos 2008 are used here in order to detect the implausibility if the occurrence frequency is lower than a preset threshold then the value is considered as implausible Domain constraints Some domain constraints and property typing restrictions can also be used to detect implausible values For example if a property age is typed as “xsd nonNegativeInte ger” then a negative value of age should be considered as implausible Calculate value quality score For the values that are not considered as implausible a quality score is computed We believe that the aspects of the value itself e g how often it appears in a specified set and the aspects of the quality of its data source can be equally important and that is why we resulted in a list of the following for criteria The homogeneity of a value The frequency of appearance of a value among all the values for a property within the group of reconciled references Its occurrence frequency The frequency of appearance of a value among all the values for a property within the whole dataset If a value appears several times inside a dataset for the same property then it is more reliable as it is less likely to contain spelling errors The freshness of its source The last update of the data source Data sources that are recently updated tend to be considered as more reliable The reliability of its source The users can explicitly give their preference towards one or ano ther data source These preferences are used to fix a reliability value in [0 1] If no such prefe rence is given all data sources are considered equally reliable For more detailed descriptions on the homogeneity the occurrence frequency and the fresh ness see the definitions in Saïs et Thomopoulos 2008 The global quality score of a given value is the average of these criteria is computed Indeed other aggregation functions can be used as a weighted average a maximum a minimum etc The score is then normalized and represented on a qualitative scale with the following values 258 Giannopoulou et al excellent medium poor As we will see below this scale will serve for querying the informa tion on the metadata ontology Discover relations For any value that is not considered as implausible the system is trying to discover how the value is related to the other possible values for the property The possible relations are More Precise a string inclusion control is applied here as well as querying a knowledge base to detect possible subsumption relations for hierarchical values to select the more precise va lue Examples Paris is more precise than France "10 05 1999" is more precise than "1999" Synonym several APIs for detecting synonyms are used to determine whether two values are synonyms Example England is a synonym of UK In case the property is explicitly defined as mono valued the value with the best quality score is chosen Otherwise both values are kept in the property Incompatible the system refers to a list of expert rules to detect possible logical incompatibi lities between the values of one property or several properties For example if we declare in a knowledge base that a property hasFunction is functionnal and hasFunction X ′′ PrimeMinister′′ ∧hasFunction X ′′ President′′ ⇒ ⊥ then if the property hasFunction has these two values these last will be declared as incompatible According to the relations the quality score is affected positively or negatively by a bonus or a malus The values are then sorted by their quality score For mono valued properties the value with the highest quality score is chosen For multi valued properties all the plausible values are kept For each value the system stores all the information that led to the calculation of the score or the reason of implausibility 2 2 Provenance of Fusion Decisions Since the calculation of the quality score and the selection of the appropriate value is more complex we realize that offering explanations on the provenance of the fusion decisions is a useful feature To achieve this we found the reification mechanism also used in Saïs et Thomopoulos 2008 more flexible and suitable for our representation needs The reification mechanism allows to enrich the RDF declarations by adding new elements Substantially it offers the possibility to create a metadata ontology describing existing RDF triples The data fusion metadata ontology We introduce a data fusion metadata ontology in order to use the RDF reification mechanism to annotate fused data by the quality information that are exploited to achieve the fusion decisions see Figure 1 The rdf Statement class is enriched by the object property hasQuality The main class Quality has three object properties which organize the different quality aspects The hasCriteria property groups up all the measures used to calculate the quality score the hasRelations brings together the relations of the value with other values and the hasIndicators contains the remaining information A metadata document conforming to this ontology is produced by the system as a result of the data fusion algorithm It provides descriptions for the quality measures of the value and the reasons why it was chosen or excluded e g which rule it violates the values that are more precise than it etc However the initial purpose of the metadata document is to be automatically queried Depending on the quality scale of a value excellent medium poor different queries are intended to provide a "story" explaining the aspects of the value’s quality 259 Linked Data Fusion FIG 1 – The Metadata Ontology Example An excerpt of the metadata document is displayed below We are using the names pace dfa standing for data fusion annotation In this example the two values for the property dfa first_name are presented and annotated with all the useful information concerning their quality Specifically the implausible value Jacues contains only the information about its ho mogeneity which is very low 0 015 and thus accounts for its exclusion from the list of plausible values On the other side for the plausible value Jacques all the information concer ning the calculation of its quality score are contained in the file For this example if the system queries the metadata document for the value Jacues the answer would be "The value is implau sible due to very low appearance in the data sources Possible reason misspelling " while for the value Jacques it will be "The value is the only plausible one It has a combination of high appearance in the data source and high level of trust on its data source" PERSON 17123430093 rdf type PhysicalPerson v1 rdf type Value q1 rdf type Quality c1 rdf type

used to test our approach are provided by the INA partner of the ANR project Qualinca We considered a set of groups of 10819 reconciled instances pairwise linked using owl sameAs links that represent french famous persons and content notices where they are involved In Table 1 a we show the distribution of the reconciled instances groups These instances are described using different properties as

qualityValue = “medium” 3233 61 95 % qualityValue = “poor” 1983 38 % TAB 1 – Table a Groups of reconciled instances Table b First data fusion results In Table 1 b we show the first results obtained by our data fusion approach From the annotation file we extracted the number of distinct values the number of values that are detected as implausible and the ones that are plausible thanks to the frequency computation The three valued scale excellent medium poor was validated with the domain experts since it captures the intuitive idea of neutral positive negative score It could be more precise with 5 values for instance but this would still be a refinement of the three valued scale For the quality value that is computed we used three values of thresholds to determine them if qualityScore ≥ 0 67 then qualityValue = “excellent” if 0 33 <qualityScore > 0 67 then qualityValue = “medium” if qualityScore ≤ 0 33 then qualityValue = “poor” What we can observe from these results is that more than 64% of values are detected as implausible and considered as inappropriate for the corresponding properties Furthermore from the plausible values almost 62% of the values have a quality value that is medium what is consolidate the results of the first step concerning the selection of the plausible values More qualitative experiments are needed to better qualify the reasons why the 38% of values having a poor quality value appear as plausible 4 Conclusion In this work we have presented an effort to study in depth the problem of data fusion in the context of Linked Data We have shown that our approach provides strong additions 261 Linked Data Fusion on the calculation of a value quality score and includes the original idea of keeping track of the provenance of the fusion decisions The annotation ontology we have proposed in order to represent the aspects of the value quality offers the possibility of automatical querying to obtain specified responses and explanations We have achieved a first implementation of the system and studied several bibliographic datasets as well as ways to evaluate our experiment results Several directions will be worth exploring In particular it would be interesting to look into different scenarios to exploit the fused data as well as use further quality criteria We could also experiment with different combinations of the criteria Additional experiments will allow defining generic thresholds for our variables and to discover the best combination of weights for the calculation of the quality score 5
