Twitter gives peo ple the ability to communicate interact collaborate with each other reply to messages from others and create conversations These services can be seen as very large information repository containing millions of text messages usually organized into complex networks involving users interacting with each other at specific times Several works have proposed tools for tweets search focused only to retrieve relevant tweets Therefore users are unable to explore the results or retrieve more relevant tweets based on the content and may get lost or become frustrated by the information overload In this paper we propose a new method to retrieve conversation on microblog ging sites particularly Twitter It’s based on content analysis and content enrich ment The goal of our method is to present a more informative result compared to conventional search engine The proposed method has been implemented and evaluated by comparing it to Google and Twitter Search engines and we obtained very promising results 1 Introduction Last years People are becoming more communicative through expansion of services and multi platform applications such as blogs forums and social networks which establishes social and collaborative backgrounds This behavior leads to an accumulation of an enormous amount of information Among these platforms are so called microblogs Furthermore microblogging services Boyd et al 2010 gives people the ability to communicate interact collaborate with each other reply to messages from others and create conversations While communicating people share different kind of information like common knowledge opinions emotions infor mation resources and their likes or dislikes The analysis of those communications can be use ful for commercial applications such as trends monitoring reputation management and news broadcasting In addition one of main characteristic of microblogging services is that users are not limited to produce contents they can get involved indirectly in conversations with other 389 Detecting Users Interactions on Microblogging Sites users by liking and sharing user’s posts Several works have proposed tools for tweets search focused only to retrieve relevant tweets Therefore users are unable to explore the results or retrieve more relevant tweets based on the content and may get lost or become frustrated by the information overload In addition finding good results concerning the given subjects needs to consider the entire context However context can be derived from user interactions This paper proposed a conversation retrieval method which can be used to extract con versation from twitter Comparing with current methods the new proposed not only extract directly reply tweets but also relevant tweets which might be retweets or comments and other possible interactions The method extract extensive posts beyond conventional conversation The rest of the document is organized as follows we begin by presenting related work address ing conversation retrieval on microblogging sites In section 3 we propose our method allows extracting user’s content interactions The experimentation and evaluation results are detailed in section 4 The final section presents a summary of our work and future dicrections 2 Related Work Conversation retrieval is a new search paradigm for microblogging sites It results from the intersection of Information Retrieval and Social Network Analysis SNA Most of microblog ging services provide a way to retrieve relevant information Jabeur et al 2012 Cherichi and Faiz 2013 but lack the ability to provide all tweets discussion There have been few previous researches dealing specifically with conversation detection In addition existing conversation retrieval approaches for microblogging sites Cogan et al 2012 Magnani et al 2010 2011 2012 have so far focused on the particular case of a conversation formed by directly replying tweets Magnani et al 2011 proposed a user based tree model for retrieving conversations from microblogs They considered only tweets that directly respond to other tweets by the use of sign as a marker of addressivity The downside is that this method does not consider tweets that do not contain the sign Similarly Cogan et al 2012 proposed a method to build conversation graphs formed by users replying to tweets In this case a tweet can only directly reply to other tweet However users can get involved indirectly in conversations communi ties by commenting liking sharing user’s posts and other possible interactions In Kumar et al 2010 the authors concentrated on different microblogging conversations aspects They proposed a simple model that produces basic conversation structures taking into account the identities of each conversation member Other related works Huang et al 2010 focusing on different aspects of microblogging conversation that deal respectively with conversation tagging and topics identification 3 Twitter Conversation Detection Method TCOND We propose a method which combines a set of conversational features and the directly exchanged text messages in order to extract extensive posts beyond conventional conversation In addition we defined a conversation as a set of short text messages posted by a user at specific timestamp on the same topic These messages can be directly replied to other users by using " username" or indirectly by liking retweeting commenting and other possible interactions In the next part we will present more details about our two approach steps 390 R Belkaroui et al 3 1 Step 1 Constructing Direct Conversation In this step we aim to collect all tweets in reply directly to other tweets Obviously a reply to a user will always begin with " username" Our goal in this step is to create reply tree The reply tree construction process consists of two algorithms run in parallel recursive root finder algorithm and iterative search algorithm Algorithm 1 Recursive Root Finder A twitter Let T be a tweet collected from Twitter ID tweet while Ti =root do Extract Ti 1 by matching field "in reply to status id" end while A twitter = A twitter – 1 Let T0 is the root first tweet published of the conversation C and T is a single tweet of the conversation retrieved Let consider Ti the type of tweet T A tweet can have three types root reply or retweet The goal of the Recursive Root Finder Algorithm is to identify the conversation root T0 given T Note that when the algorithm starts ∣∣T ∣∣ is not known Once the conversation root T0 has been established the Iterative Search Algorithm is used to seek the remainder of conversation C by searching all tweets addressed to Ti using matching field "in reply to status id" It is run repeatedly until some conditions indicating that the conversation has ended are met 3 2 Step 2 Relevant Indirect Tweets We define new features that may help to detect tweets related indirectly to a same conver sation The goal is to extract tweets that may be relevant to the conversation without the use of the symbol We use the following notations in the sequel • ti is a set of tweets present in direct conversation tweets in reply to other tweets directly • tj is a tweet that can be linked indirectly to conversation The features we used are • Using the same URL By sharing an URL an author would enrichment the information published in his tweet This feature is applied to collect tweets that share the same URL P1 ti tj = { 1 if t contains the same URL 0 otherwise 1 • Hashtags Similarity The symbol called hashtag is used to mark a topic in a tweet or to follow conversation Any user can categorize or follow topics with hashtags We used this feature to collect tweets that share the same hashtags 391 Detecting Users Interactions on Microblogging Sites P2 ti tj = { 1 if t contains the same hashtag 0 otherwise 2 • Tweets Time Difference The time difference is highly important feature for detecting tweets linked indirectly to conver sation We use the time attribute to efficiently remove tweets having a large distance in terms of time compared to conversation root • Tweets Publication dates Date attribute are highly important for detecting conversations Users tend to post tweets about conversational topic within a short time period The Euclidean distance has been used to calculate how similar two posts publication dates are • Content We compute the textual similarity between each element in tj ti taking the maximum value as the similarity measure between two messages The similarity between two elements is calculated using the well known tf idf cosine similarity sim ti tj • Similarity Function Finally the similarity between tweets indirectly linked to conversation and tweets which are present in the reply tree is calculated by a linear combination between their attributes 4 Experiments and Results The following experiment has been designed to gather some knowledge on the impact of our results on end users For this experiment we have selected three events and queried our dataset using Google 1 Twitter search engine 2 and our method TCOND Then we have asked a set of 100 assessors to rate the top 10 results of every search task with three relevance levels namely highly relevant value equal to 2 relevant value equal to 1 or irrelevant value equal to 0 In order to measure the results quality we use the Normalized Discounted Cu mulative Gain NDCG at 10 for all the judged events In addition we used a second metric which is the Precision at top 10 The dataset has been obtained by monitoring microblogging system Twitter posts over the period of July August 2013 In particular we used a sample of about 113 000 posts containing trending topic keywords using Twitter’s streaming API Trending topics have been determined directly by Twitter and we have selected the most frequent ones during the monitoring period 1 google com 2 Search twitter com 392 R Belkaroui et al 4 1 Experimental Outcomes and Interpretation Results We compare our conversation retrieval method with the results returned by Google and by Twitter search engine using two metrics namely the P 10 and the NDCG 10 From this comparison we obtained the values summarized in Table 1 where we notice that our method overcomes the results given by both of Google and Twitter The reason of these promising values is the fact that we combine a set of conversational features and direct replies method to retrieve conversation may have a significant impact on the users’ evaluation P 10 Average% NDCG Average% Task1 Google 59 62 56 86 Twitter 65 73 59 71 TCOND 73 28 64 52 Task2 Google 57 31 56 02 Twitter 62 78 58 45 TCOND 67 27 62 73 Task3 Google 63 21 66 52 Twitter 65 88 68 46 TCOND 77 27 69 33 TAB 1 – Table of Values for Computing our Worked Example Focusing on the three messages selections we observe that all conversations obtained with our method receive higher scores with compared to Google and Twitter’s selection According to the free comments of some users and following the qualitative analysis of the posts in the three selections we can see that Google and twitter received lower scores not because they contained posts judged as less interesting but because some posts were considered not relevant with regard to the searched topic Concentration on the three messages selections we observe that all conversations selections obtained with twitter search has higher scores with respect to Google’s selection These results lead us toward a more general interpretation of the collected data It appears that the social metrics usage have a significant impact on the users’ degree interest in the retrieved posts In addition the retrieving conversations process from Social Network differs from traditional Web information retrieval it involves human communication aspects like the degree interest in the conversation explicitly or implicitly expressed by the interacting people 5 Conclusion This work explored a new method for detecting conversation on microblogging sites an in formation retrieval activity exploiting a set of conversational features in addition to the directly exchanged text messages to retrieve conversation Our experimental results have highlighted many interesting points First including social features and the concept of direct conversation 393 Detecting Users Interactions on Microblogging Sites in the search function improves the relevance of tweets informativeness and also provides re sults that are considered more satisfaction with respect to a traditional tweet search task Future work will further research the conversational aspects by including human communication as pects like the degree of interest in the conversation and their influence popularity by gathering data from multiple sources from Social Networks in real time References Boyd D S Golder and G Lotan 2010 Tweet tweet retweet Conversational aspects of
